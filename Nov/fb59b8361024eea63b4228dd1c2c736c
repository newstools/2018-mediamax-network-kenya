Bungoma-based Rangers Handball Club raced to three wins in four matches over the weekend to keep title hopes alive in the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) men’s league. Rangers, however, suffered their first loss in the hands of Strathmore University following a 33-20 outcome. The loss denied Rangers a chance to go fourth position on the log after 14 matches, settling for fifth instead on the 22-team standings, from seventh place at 25 points, three points behind leaders Ulinzi. Gerald Juma’s side first took on Boomerang on Saturday morning, managing a 26-17 win. The first half was tightly-contested with Rangers heading to the breather with a one-goal advantage at 13-12. However, the side tightened their defence in the second half to score another 13 goals and deny Boomerang who could just manage five in 30 minutes. Juma’s charges were not finished yet as they humiliated University of Eldoret Pippers 27-21 in a match played on the extremely wet Kaloleni grounds as the skies opened moments to kick off and the match had to wait. On Sunday, Rangers battled their hearts out to narrowly win by two goals against a resilient Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT). The match went to the breather tied at 14-14 but Rangers held their own under immense pressure to force the win. “We had set out a target on finishing in the top three in the regular league and fighting for the Super Cup and despite this weekend’s loss, our dreams are still valid. The remaining seven matches are crucial as they determine our placing. We are in a good position to realise our dreams,” said Juma. In other matches, it was a bad day in office for Eldoret’s Pippers as they lost three of their four matches managing a 37- 32 win against Nanyuki and followed it up with a 27-21 reverse against Rangers, 38-34 to Mt Kenya University and 32-30 to Kenyatta University.
