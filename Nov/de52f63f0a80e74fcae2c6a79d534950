Former Senator of Kakamega, Bonny Khalwale, has urged Ford Kenya leader, who is Bungoma Senator Moses Wetangula and ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi, to borrow a leaf from NASA leader Raila Odinga and his Wiper counterpart Kalonzo Musyoka, who he says are now out looking friendship from other political leaders across the country. Speaking during a funds drive in aid of PAG Mukhonje in Kakamega county, Khalwale said that it is shocking that NASA leader Raila Odinga, who rallied Kenyans against Â the Jubilee government has now turned out to be the one in the same government. He has also declared his support for DP Ruto ahead of 2022 presidential race.
