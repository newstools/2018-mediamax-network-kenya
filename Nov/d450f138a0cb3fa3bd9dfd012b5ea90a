Peter Mutuku More than 300,000 households in Machakos county will be enrolled in the Universal Health Coverage (UHC) programme to be launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta on December 1. On Friday, Governor Alfred Mutua urged local residents to take advantage of the ongoing household registration to enroll in the programme which will enable them to access free healthcare services in all public hospitals. “To ensure we register as many residents as possible, in addition to the door to door household registration, we will set up registration drives on market days in all sub-counties, set up registration desks at public facilities like hospitals, police stations and even supermarkets” Mutua said at the Machakos County Referral Hospital. Machakos is one of the four counties picked for the year-long pilot programme. Others are Nyeri, Isiolo and Kisumu.
