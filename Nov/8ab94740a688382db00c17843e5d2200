The committee, in its report of the National government audited accounts for the financial year 2014/15, wants the CS to have updated database where the performance of contractors is maintained. According to the committee, the database should be publicised at all times to enable government departments to make informed decisions when awarding contracts. Further, the committee wants feasibility studies undertaken and mitigation measures relating to infrastructure projects developed to enhance the implementation of key structural projects. “This is evident in the Judiciary projects of construction of law courts in Narok, Eldama Ravine, Mavoko, Kakamega and Lodwar which suffered slow progress due to unforeseen bottlenecks in the work plan execution, resulting to unmet timelines,” report reads. The committee also recommended that interest payments arising from delay in honouring payment certificates be avoided if ministries, departments and agencies prioritise the preparation of annual procurement plans and attendant work plans to facilitate prompt requisitioning of funds from the National Treasury. The National Treasury has also been directed to ring-fence project funds for timely releases on requisitioning and deal with rampant unapproved project work and cost variations on government contracts.
