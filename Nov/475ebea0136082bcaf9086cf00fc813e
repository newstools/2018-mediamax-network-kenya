Detectives from Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) on Thursday confiscated Heroin and Methamphentamine (meth) at the General Post Office (GPO) concealed in wood carvings, rolls of thread and a book of maps. The 1kg drug haul valued at Sh1 million were destined to two addresses in China and Greece but attracted suspicion from Postal Corporation of Kenya cargo staff who informed the police. A thorough inspection by the police revealed the drugs intricately concealed in a yellow roll of thread, an atlas for young learners and wood carvings. DCI have commenced investigations to ascertain the senderâ€™s identity and initiated contact with their foreign counterparts as well as Interpol to nab the recipients as well.
