Frederick Likuyani @PeopleSport11 The second phase on the rehabilitation on Bukhungu Stadium is set to commence on January 2019 as the County Government is projected to seeing the project comes to completion by 2012 elevating the facility into an International facility. The County Government of Kakamega is not yet done with the iconic Bukhungu Stadium, As the county eagerly awaits completion of the Stadium, the facility’s planning committee is working round the clock to meet targets and timelines to ensure its completion by the year 2021. Governor Wycliffe Ambetsa Oparanya was on Wednesday briefed by the committee on progress so far made before Phase 2 kicks off. Led by county executive for roads, public works and energy Collins Matemba, the governor was taken through a presentation that highlighted key considerations that will shape the multi-million shilling project as it claims its international standards. Key considerations include; both environmental and economic sustainability, capacity, technology and timelines. “Construction works to usher in the second phase commence in January 2019. With a capacity of 25,000 (seated) people, conference facilities, indoor (gymnasiums), a recreational park, a swimming pool, media centre, practice pitches, banks and business shops among others, the stadium is expected to meet international standards not only for sports and recreational activities but also meetings and conferences. Of utmost interest in the project’s new trajectory perhaps are the technology sphere it will operate in and the quality finishing materials that will be used, besides a mix of steel and glass structures. A combination of teflon, fibreglass and fluoro ethylene will add colour and beauty to the elegant new structure,” pointed out Matemba.
