Senate Committee on Labour and Social Welfare says Mombasa county should get two per cent of revenue generated by port of Mombasa and Kenya Ferry Services (KFS). Chairman of the committee Johnston Sakaja said the county government should be allowed to oversee the activities of the two parastatals as stipulated in the Local Content Bill, 2016 and Fourth Schedule of the Constitution of Kenya 2010, which states that “ferries and harbours” are functions and powers of a devolved unit. “The Local Content Bill seeks to regulate local ownership, control and financing of gas, oil and natural resources of which the harbour and sea, the focal point where KPA and KFS operate, are natural,” he said. “What is the difference between the port and oil in Turkana?” he posed while addressing members of Mombasa County Assembly at the Treasury square. Mombasa Senator Mohamed Faki and nominated MCA Moses Aran had raised concerns over meagre allocation to the county by the National Treasury when the committee held a joint sitting with their counterpart at the Mombasa Assembly. Faki  said that the defunct  Mombasa  Municipal operated KFS until 1980s when KPA took over its operation. “KFS annual budget is Sh1 billion while county’s is Sh12 billion. There is no reason the county whose capacity then was smaller than now, cannot operate the ferry,” he said. Aran said Mombasa had recorded massive job losses following introduction of Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). “It has taken away 70 per cent of transport business. When Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho predicted that services would be transferred to Nairobi he was bashed but it has now become a reality,” he said. Faki said it is unconstitutional for importers to be forced to clear their cargo from Inland Container Depot (ICD) at Embakasi.
