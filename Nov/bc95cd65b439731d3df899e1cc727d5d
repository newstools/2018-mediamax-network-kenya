Milliam Murigi @millymur1 Lakewood School in Komarock has for the second year running produced 20 candidates among Nairobi county’s 100 top performers in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams. Ruth Okwisa, the top pupil in the school, which registered 300 candidates, got 436 marks. She was followed by Vincent Kinyua with 435 and Cate Nyakio with 428. Even though the school registered a drop of nine marks for their top pupil compared to last year, the school director Samuel Kimamo said the number of pupils who got 400 marks and above this year was more than last year. “Though none of our pupil’s got 445 like last year, we are happy with the exemplary performance,” he said. This is the second time the school is producing 50 pupils with more than 400 marks.  Last year, the school produced 52.
