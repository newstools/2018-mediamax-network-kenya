Wafula Chebukati, now claims a petition presented to parliament seeking his removal is fueled by malice and bitterness.. Chebukati claims the petitioner, Seth Panyako, is hitting back after he was ordered to pay the election petition cost slapped on him by the high court in Kakemaga after he failed to successful challenge the election of Cleopa Malala. Chebukati says Panyako should not be allowed to use parliament to fight his political wars.
Panyako, a trade unionist has made a fresh attempt to remove IEBC Chairman, Wafula Chebukati, from office over claims of irregularly altering Kakamega senate results during last year’s polls.
