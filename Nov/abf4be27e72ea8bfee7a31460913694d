 The government has contracted loans worth Sh92.1 billion from development partners from March 1 to June 30, this year, a new report from the National Treasury shows. The loans include three new loans totalling to Sh14.6 billion and Sh77.48 billion that the government guaranteed to Kenya Airways (KQ) limited as the borrower. Regarding the KQ loan, the US Exim bank will give Sh52.2 billion while Sh23.3 billion will come from local banks to enable it to buy aircraft as well as relieve its liquidity challenges in the next five years. The three new loans worth Sh14.6 billion, the report says,Â  were acquired to finance projects in the energy, transport and agriculture sectors. The report was tabled in the National Assembly last week Thursday by Leader of Majority Aden Duale.
