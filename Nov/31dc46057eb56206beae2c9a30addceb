Kirera Mwiti and George Oduor @PeopleDailyKe Nakuru county government will construct more than 15 modern toilets on Nairobi-Nakuru highway to address the perennial problem of open defecation. The Public Health department is targeting passengers and long distance drivers who have been relieving themselves by the roadside. This came as it emerged that the county spends close to Sh1 billion annually to treat diseases caused by poor sanitation. County director of Public Health Samuel King’ori said Kinungi, Kikopey, Salgaa, Kibunja, Total Junction, Nakuru North, Longonot, Subukia, Keringet among others will benefit. He spoke during the opening of a new fecal sludge treatment facility in Naivasha constructed by Sanivation Company. Company director Dickson Ochieng said the plant would use human waste and saw-dust to create briquettes which would be used as an alternative source of energy. Meanwhile, Kochia ward in Homa Bay county has been declared an Open Defecation Free (ODF) Zone. Speaking during celebrations to mark World Toilet Day, Health Executive Richard Muga said residents in the ward use toilets instead of relieving themselves in open fields and bushes. The health department, he said, will use the area as a case study  to enable other regions to attain similar feat adding that the county has partnered with SNV Netherlands Development Organisation to identify areas that are not suitable for toilet construction.
