Dinah Ondari @dinahondari Auditor General Edward Ouko has expressed concern that most counties have failed to collect revenue to correspond with their annual budgets, resulting in a denial of critical services and development projects promised to county residents. In his latest reports on county executives for the year 2016/17, Ouko is concerned that the counties are also unable to explain the under-collection of revenue. The affected counties include Mandera, Baringo, Kitui, Wajir, Embu and Liakipia. For instance, Mandera budgeted to collect Sh265 million during the year under review but collected only Sh55 million. “This revealed unexplained revenue of Sh200 million which was a 30 per cent decrease from the financial year. No explanation was given for the cause of the decline,” the AG notes In Baringo, the revenue collected was Sh281 million against a budget of Sh330 million. “Consequently, there was a revenue shortfall of Sh48 million, or 15 per cent of the budgeted amount. So far, no satisfactory explanation has been given for the revenue shortfall,” he said. The AG was also concerned that other counties like Laikipia are doing little to pursue debts amounting to millions of shillings. “Some of the receipt books were issued in 2013 and no effort has been made by management to recover them. Consequently, the completeness and accuracy of county own generated balance of Sh543, 756,513 for the year ending  June 30, 2017, could not be confirmed,” says the report. The county is also on the spot for operating 51 bank accounts contrary to the law which allows for six. Out of the 51, the details of 21 accounts were never presented for audit. Wajir county had budgeted to collect 230 million during the year of review but only collected Sh75 million, resulting in under collection Sh154 million. “It was further observed that the county’s revenue collection had declined from Sh108,144,589 Sh81,754,275 which was collected in years 14/15 and 15/16, respectively. No reason was given by management for the failure to collect revenue as budgeted .” “Due to the decline, the county did not meet its revenue target and as a result provisions of services to the county residents hampered,” notes the Auditor General.
