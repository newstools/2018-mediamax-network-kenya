Irene Githinji @gitshee Olive Mwea of Nairobi’s Riara School and Rawlings Odhiambo of Kakamega Hills School emerged the best candidates, tying with 453 marks out of the possible 500 in this year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam. They beat more than a million candidates in an exam that registered an overall improvement in performance over previous years. Joining Olive and Rawlings in the top 10 bracket were Leonard Asanga, 451 (Kabarak Primary), Patrick Kigen, 446 (Mountain View), Emmanuel Njenga, 445 (Stepping Stone), Sharon Namisi, 445 (Tender Care Academy), Njagi Ronnie Gathuku, 445, Samantha Bett, 444 (Acacia Academy), Gabriel Mburu 444 (Utafiti), Mary Mbinya 444 (County Mixed Day and Boarding School) and Wanjohi Ivy Nyambura 443 (High Peak Junior Academy). Once again, elite private academies took the lead, with Gilglil Hills, Makini, Utawala, St Peter’s Elite, Little Friends Junior, Kabarak Primary, Lakewoods, Tender Care Academy, Riara School and Rockfields producing the biggest number of high scorers. At Utawala, 40 candidates scored 400 marks and above. It was also good news for candidates, as the government announced all the 1,052, 364 would join Form One, whose selection is set for December 3. There will only be one round of selection. This year’s results were an improvement of last year’s, with at least 12,273 candidates scoring over 400 marks and above compared to 9,845 in 2017. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed released the results yesterday from Star of the Sea Primary School in Mombasa. She said the exams were conducted on “one of the levelest playing fields ever”. Only four candidates had their results cancelled over impersonation, but they will be allowed to re-sit their exams next year. The CS assured that the ministry had wiped out cases where examinations were leaked with abandon, adding that the few cases of attempted cheating were nipped in the bud and dealt with promptly. And on the high cases of teenage pregnancies, Amina said preliminary statistics indicated the magnitude of the problem was even bigger than initially thought, describing it as a national challenge. “I have directed the (Quality Assurance and Standards Directorate) team to expand the scope of their analysis,” she said and urged parents to inculcate good behaviour in children. Teachers Service Commission chief executive Nancy Macharia said they had deregistered 32 teachers for engaging in sexual relationships with students. “Of concern is that some of our head teachers and teachers, under whose care these children are entrusted, are the same people taking advantage of them. The commission is taking this very seriously and those found to be guilty will be dealt with accordingly,” she said. The exams were released earlier than previous years, just 18 days after the candidates wrote their last paper. At least 12,273 candidates attained 400 marks and above compared to 9,846 and 5,143 last year, and in 2016, respectively while 574,927 candidates attained between 200 and 300 marks compared to 529,897 and 501,552 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Those who attained between 100 and 200 marks were 234,573 compared to 234,308 and 221,438 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. Another 2,177 candidates scored between 0 and 100 marks compared to 2,360 and in the last two years. Female candidates performed better than their male counterparts in English, Kiswahili and Kenya Sign Language while male candidates performed better in mathematics, science and social studies and religious education. At least 2,495 candidates with special needs sat for the exam, with the highest-scorer in that category bagging 446 marks. Last year, 2,038 candidates with special needs sat the exam, with the top scorer attaining 426 marks out of the possible 500. Amina said the improvement was testimony that children with special needs can excel given a fair and conducive environment. More girls registered for the exam in 23 counties compared to their male counterparts. They are   Kakamega, Nairobi, Meru, Bungoma, Vihiga, Siaya, Kitui, Embu, Kisumu, Makueni, Machakos, Nakuru, Elgeyo Marakwet, Kisii, Nyamira, Tharaka Nithi, Kericho, Uasin Gishu, Kirinyaga, Trans Nzoia, Nandi, Mombasa and Bomet counties.
