Barry Silah @obel_barry Kenya’s national Cricket team have a date with destiny as they begin their attempted rally back into Division Two status in the World Cricket League qualifiers in Oman. The 14-man team led by Kanbis Sports Clubs pair of Dhiren Gondaria and Rakep Patel face the hosts today in the 50-over match that will determine the nature of their progress in the tournament. There have been many off-field problems at camp characterised by lack of morale due to unpaid allowances by Cricket Kenya which have their accounts frozen. However former Chairperson Jackie Janmohammed on Monday bailed the team with her USD 15,440 (Sh1,544,000) contribution for the 10-day Championship. Kenya who was sensationally booted out of the Division Two group after failing to win a single match in Namibia late last year, will look for some reprieve in the harsh lessons learnt. In coach Lameck Onyango, they have an experienced hand that could help them glide through in their five matches. All-rounder and middle order batsman Collins Obuya who was first capped in 2003, meanwhile failed to travel with the team with his place being taken by batsman Narendra Patel. No official communication is clear but critics argue that the politics that has ridden the national team lately might have forced him to do a rethink. Lucas Oluoch and Elijah Otieno who also had been unceremoniously dropped made it back to the tour after hue and cry from the concerned cricket fraternity. Speaking to the People Sport earlier in the week, senior team player Shem Ngoche issued a rallying call to his colleagues to get their groove back. “We have to play for the flag and for ourselves. It has been frustrating for the players but it is time to focus on these qualifiers. All matches will be important and so I want to urge the team to give their best.”
