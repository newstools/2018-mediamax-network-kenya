November in our awesome city is teeming with fun and sparkles. It’s clearly the second best month of the year after Drinksember…. eeerm December. Of course, because it’s a 30-day eve to the most fun month. The weather may be untrustworthy, but that’s no reason to stay holed up at home. Check out our events page for a guide on where the fun is at. We’ve put together an issue to get you ready for the holidays. As you’re stepping out to all sorts of gigs, our fashionista Ms Denim and Cateye lets you in on how to slay for less. And if you’re wondering where to hold that meet-up, we tried out somewhere new in Parklands in the Eat Out section and shared the experience. If you’re looking for the perfect addition to your streaming queue or DVD library, there’s The Grinch that we reviewed this week. It’s an updated holiday classic released this month, which the whole family will surely enjoy. It’s also nuptials season and our writer Grace Wachira has been dishing some nifty tips and etiquette on that front. Published on our wedding page, you should make the section a must read. You’ll love it, as well as the rest of our great reads, beginning with the main feature, where we look at an interesting dating phenomenon; situationships. Apparently, we’re a generation that wants to have our cake and eat it. We want the good parts of a relationship; we don’t want to be alone, we pine for that cosy intimacy, the comfortable conversations, but the responsibility that comes with serious relationships can be a tad steep a price to pay. So, we ride out the in-between, as the middle ground is not an emotionally risky place, or is it? Happy reading!  matilda.nzioki@mediamax.co.ke
