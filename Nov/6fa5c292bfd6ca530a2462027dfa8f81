The government has announced an extension of the Charter Flights Incentives programme until 2022 as it seeks to hit 1.7 million international tourist arrival targets by the end of the year. Tourism Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said the subsidy programme for airlines initiated in 2016 has seen the government spend Sh200 million to increase charter traffic to Mombasa realising a whopping ($37 million) equivalent to Sh3.1 billion in revenue generation. He said since 2016, when the charter flights incentive programme was initiated to March 2018, the sector has witnessed a significant growth of 55,000 arrivals into Mombasa and to beach hotels. The programme targeting northern Europe, central Europe and UK markets, offers a passenger subsidy of $30 (Sh3056.7) if they terminate or disembark at the Coast. “Since we started the programme we have spent Sh200 million and in return generated Sh3.1 billion, so the incentive is really working for us,” said Balala. South Coast hotels and North Coast regions of Malindi are the biggest beneficiaries since most of the clientele are Polish and Italian. “We are committed as a government to the charter incentive programme which we have already extended to 2020. I, however, believe it should be extended to 2022 because, by that time, we will have all the infrastructure to support the tourism sector here at the Coast region,” said Balala. Balala made the announcement on Wednesday when he received Tui Netherlands Charter flight which made its maiden landing at the Moi International Airport with 120 tourists on board yesterday. The charter flight will be flying to Mombasa twice a week, translating to about 360 visitors to the Kenyan coast every week. The number of charter flights destined for Mombasa from Europe has increased to 15 a week and the CS attributes 46 per cent of the growth to the charter incentive programme. “We now have a total of 15 flights a week bringing tourists directly to Mombasa International Airport, an increase from nine charter flights in November last year. We have new Tui Belgium, Tui Netherlands and Tui Brussels flights and next year, we expect a new charter flight directly from the UK,” said Balala. The arrival of the charter flight from the Netherlands comes barely two weeks after the launch of Tui Belgium charter flights into Mombasa last weekend. Netherlands is the fourth largest source market from Europe with 22,108 visitors last year, denoting a growth of 34 per cent since 2016 when it recorded 16,489 arrivals. “This is indeed a major boost to the coastal tourism business,” said the CS. European markets which include the UK, Germany and Italy record the highest tourist arrival numbers into Kenya and especially the coast. “The preference of visitors from this country for exotic beach destination is timely since our coastal tourism product will meet their expectation. Our beach product captured the attention of the world with the naming of Diani beach by the World Travel Awards (WTA) as Africa’s leading beach destination in October for the sixth time in a row” said Balala. Balala also put on the spot, officials at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport and Mombasa International Airport over continued harassment of visitors. He challenged them to up their game and ensure seamless and quick turnaround of the facilities to avoid frustrating visitors upon arrival. He singled out JKIA, where he claimed immigration, security and customs departments and particularly the police are frustrating visitors.
