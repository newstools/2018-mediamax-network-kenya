Some musicians from Mt Kenya region are now blaming disunity for the cancelled meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta. They have, however, formed a Sacco to highlight and deal with issues facing them. Addressing journalists at a Kiambu hotel yesterday, the artistes said they registered Talented Musicians Sacco under the Sports ministry. President Uhuru had invited the artistes to State House during the burial of legendary musician Joseph Kamaru last month. Benga maestro John De’Mathew is the Sacco chair while secular music songbird Loise Kim is the treasurer. “Musicians in Kenya have gone through hell in the hands of pirates who copy our songs before we even launch them,” said De’Mathew. Kim said the Sacco will be a platform for artistes to get assistance from the government. She said they would present their plight to Uhuru soon. “We will use our new found unity to demand that the government makes stringent laws to guard against piracy. We also want to get our fair share when our music is used as call-back tunes,” she said. They have also set up a vetting committee check credentials of those seeking registration.
