New kids on the Women Premier League (WPL) block Trans Nzoia Falcons welcome Kisumu All Starlet to Kitale for what could be a nerve wrecking match for the two sides as they seek to keep their good run going. Falcons, who have come as the surprise package in the league, have suffered just one loss in 20 matches played and it was in the hand of their weekend visitors All Starlets in Kisumu. The Justin Okiring coached side welcome their Kisumu-based counterparts with a goal of extending their wins to 15 while the later chase a 10th win in their 22nd match. A win for Okiring’s charges will take them to 50 point, four points behind second placed Thika Queens. If the tables are turned, All Starlets move from 10th place to sixth at 31 points. After today’s match, Falcons travel to Eldama Ravine where they take on Baringo Starlets on Sunday. Falcons head to the match without the services of Moreen Khakasa and Martha Amunyolete who are in camp with the national team Harambee Starlets as they prepare for the Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON). The team’s top scorer Tumaini Waliaula will also be missing in action as she is sitting for her national exam starting next week and has been exempted from any matches from this weekend. “The absence of the three players is a blow to my winning first team but I will manage with the remaining players. When we lost to All Starlets in Kisumu we were in the process of finding a winning team for the premier league having just been promoted. I am confident we are much better now and we can win this match,” said Okiring. On their part, All Starlets are missing their lead striker Bertha Omita who is also with the national team. The left-footed forward is behind All Starlets’ recent good run, having scored in all their matches in the second leg of the WPL.
