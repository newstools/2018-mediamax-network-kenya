Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi A Dutch was Friday charged with defiling two girls. Hans Egon Dieter Vriens, who was also charged with two alternative counts of committing an indecent act with the eight and 10-year-olds, denied the charges when he appeared before Milimani Resident Magistrate Muthoni Nzibe. According to the charge sheet, he committed the offences in 2011 and 2014 in Roysambu estate, Nairobi. The prosecution said the 66-year-old man was arrested on Thursday at Olinet Apartments in Roysambu area after being on the run for the last six months. The prosecution opposed his release on bail claiming he is a flight risk as he has no fixed abode after changing  his known residence. Nzibe heard that the suspect was found hiding in a closet in a vacant house within the apartment to evade arrest and was, therefore, likely to disappear if released on bail. “The accused person is also believed to be in communication with some of the witnesses,” said the prosecutor. In response, the suspect, who had no legal representation, refuted claims by the prosecution and urged the court to admit him to bail. Vriens claimed to have a house in Kitui where his wife and daughter live and a  business apartment in Nairobi. He claimed he was admitted to a Mombasa hospital at the time the police say he was in hiding. He accused the police of putting him in the closet where they claimed to have found him and denied being in contact with witnesses. Nzibe remanded him pending hearing of the testimony by the two minors. The case will be mentioned on November 16.
