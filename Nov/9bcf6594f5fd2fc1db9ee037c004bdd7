Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe An orphaned  street boy in Trans Nzoia county defied all odds to score 406 marks in this year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) examination. Abraham John, who has been living in the streets of Kitale town, could not hide his joy when the exam results were released on Monday. He attributed his success to  hard work and the assistance of well-wishers who took him from the streets and enrolled him at Kings Prince Royal school in Kitale town. “I lost my parents some years ago and I have been surviving on help from well wishers,” John said. King Prince Royal headteacher Phillip Nyongesa said he met John while he was in Standard Five and  enrolled him in his school. “I came across John in the streets and I realised he was a bright boy. I enrolled him and allowed him to learn without having to pay a single cent,” Nyongesa said. John’s dream is to proceed to Lenana School in Nairobi and later train as a pilot. He is appealing to the well-wishers to sponsor his secondary school education. John was among 9,846 who scored 400 and above marks, an improvement in overall performance for the third year running. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed attributed the improvement to the hard work that teachers have been putting in since the government introduced tough measures to curb cheating. Amina has also assured all candidates of a slot in Form One. They   will be the second group to join high school under 100 per cent transition policy. “The ministry has conducted a mapping of vacancies in all categories of schools. We are ready to admit more learners under the Free Day Secondary Education programme,” she said.
