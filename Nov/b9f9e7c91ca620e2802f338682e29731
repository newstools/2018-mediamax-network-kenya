Traffic Police officers on Sunday morning conducted a surprise crackdown on all PSVs in Nairobi impounding hundreds of unroadworthy matatus ahead of the official implementation of the traffic rules. This operation, left thousands of passengers stranded forcing others to walk to their intended destinations.
