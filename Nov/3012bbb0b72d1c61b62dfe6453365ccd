Quack doctor James Mugo Ndichu alias Mugo wa Wairimu will spend more time in custody pending his bail ruling on December 6.The new development came after the prosecution on Friday opposed his release on bail. Mugo has denied several charges of operating a clinic, laboratory, a pharmacy and practicing as a nurse without licences from relevant authorities.The Prosecution urged Milimani Senior Principal Magistrate Martha Mutuku to detain Mugo pending the hearing and determination of his case. They also asked the court to deny him bail saying the police are yet to complete investigations.In an affidavit filed in court by investigating officer George Oyier from the DCI’s office, he asked the court not to grant him bail on grounds he is likely to interfere with investigations and witnesses. The prosecution further said the accused has two cases pending in court in which he is alleged to have jumped bail. “There are witnesses who are yet to be traced and some need to be put under protection before he be released on bail,” said the officer. But Mugo’s lawyer Kepha Ojijo said Oyier’s application was not grounded in law. He urged the court to release his client on reasonable bail terms saying he will abide by all the conditions set by the court. Mugo, who has been in police custody for 10 days now, was remanded at Industrial Area Remand Prison until December 6 when the is expected to rule in his application. He was arrested on November 12, 2018 in Gachie Area, Kiambu County following an expose by a television station. He was arraigned in court where the police obtained orders to detain him further to complete investigations. Two people alleged to be his employees were charged and released on a Sh200,000 cash bail. Victor Kamunya, 22, and 19-year-old Risper Auma Agony told the court that they were students on internship in Mugo’s clinic.
