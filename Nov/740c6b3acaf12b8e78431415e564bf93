Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi An Eldoret court has allowed  former Kamamega District Commissioner Paul Yatich to proceed with burial plans for his  wife Loice, who was brutally murdered three weeks ago at their house in Kiplombe estate. Loice’s burial was scheduled  two weeks ago at her husband’s Talai village home in Baringo county but was indefinitely postponed following a court injunction filed by sister-in-law Esther Chirchir. Until her death, Loice worked as Curriculum Development officer at the Teachers Service Commission in Uasin Gishu county. Eldoret Resident Magistrate Nicodemus Moseti marked the case as settled after both parties involved in the feud over burial plans informed the court that they had settled the issues that has stalled the burial. Chirchir, through her lawyer Silas Kandie, asked the court to withdraw the application as they have agreed with the former DC’s family on the burial plans. “Following a series of meetings from the deceased family and those from her husband, we have agreed to withdraw the case from court and proceed with the funeral arrangements ahead of the burial day,” she said. While making his ruling, the magistrate directed that the applicant meets the cost of preservation of the body which is lying at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. “I order the applicant meets the cost of preservation of the deceased body at Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital in Eldoret. Both parties will meet their own costs in the case,” ruled Moseti. The deceased family stopped her burial accusing her husband of not involving them in the plans and also wanted  the police to first complete investigations into the brutal murder.
