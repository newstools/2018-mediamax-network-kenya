Eight students of Ambira boys high school in Siaya who were captured on video, hurling insults to Cabinet Secretaries Amina Mohammed and Dr. Fred Matiangâ€™i, were Monday detained for a further 7 days by the court, to allow police complete their investigations, even as kenyans on social media went on overdrive, giving varied views over the students conduct and arrest. The students did not take a plea as the court sets to establish their age.
