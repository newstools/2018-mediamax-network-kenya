Harambee Stars are home and dry in as far as playing in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations in Cameroon is concerned after Confederation of African Football (CAF) called off the team’s penultimate qualifying match against Sierra Leone. CAF maintains that Sierra Leone remains banned due to the interference of the game by the country’s government which in essence means that Kenya are in a vantage position to wind up either in the first or second position in the Group F of the qualifiers which guarantees them a place in the biggest Africa football extravaganza. Harambee Stars had been scheduled to face Sierra Leone in a reverse fixture at the Moi International Sports Centre on Sunday before the good news filtered in that the Leone Stars are still banished by CAF. All the results involving Sierra Leone including their 2-1 win over Harambee Stars in the first leg of the qualifier in Freetown remain annulled even as Kenya is looking ahead of their final qualifying match against Ghana’s Black Stars in Accra. In a letter from the continental governing body’s Competition’s Division, CAF cited a suspension on Sierra Leone by world governing body FIFA, noting that the status of the group will be communicated once the Executive Committee takes a final decision on the matter. “Seeing that Sierra Leone is still under suspension by FIFA, please note that the above mentioned match will not take place,” read part of the letter. “The status of the group will be communicated later on once the competent body takes a final decision in this regards,” continued the letter signed by CAF Competitions Division’s Khaled Nassar. Kenya has so far won two, lost one and shared the spoils in one match, in their quest to grace the Africa Cup of Nations from Group F, which also comprises Ghana and Ethiopia. Harambee Stars will be rubbing their hands with glee, hoping to revisit AFCON which they last graced in 2004 in Tunisia.
