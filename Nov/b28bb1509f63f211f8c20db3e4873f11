The father of former Garissa County Finance Executive Idris Mukhtar, who was shot in the head at a city hotel, yesterday petitioned the High Court seeking the removal of Governor Ali Korane. Aden Mukhtar claims the degree the governor acquired from the University of Nairobi before contesting the seat in August last year is not genuine. He urges the court to declare the governor fit for removal from office on grounds he violated the Constitution. Mukhtar while addressing the media at Milimani Law Courts, said they took Idris to India for specialised treatment but claimed the investigations are taking too long. He said his son is still in a coma and according to doctors even if he recovers, he will suffer permanent disability. “We have no faith with the Directorate of Criminal Investigations. It has been influenced by some politicians in an attempt to cover up,” said Mukhtar.
