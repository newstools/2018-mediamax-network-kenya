Even before the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam commenced, the Education ministry had promised to release results in record time. True to its word, the Ministry released the KCPE results yesterday, just about 18 days after it was completed. This has been so owing to the new equipment the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) acquired, which speeded up the marking process. Additionally, a multi-agency approach the government adopted to ensure the exam is delivered in a better environment has been lauded. Education Cabinet Secretary, Amina Mohamed said last month that the multi-agency approach ensured all loopholes were sealed. “The multi-agency approach will insulate against breach of laid down security and quality assurance measures,” the CS said. And to demonstrate readiness to safeguard the integrity of national examinations, the government deployed at least 70,000 police officers for both KCPE written on the first week of this month and Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE)  which will be completed next week. Throughout the KCPE period, CSs and other senior government officials supervised dispatch of exam materials up to the last point of use. The Ministry stepped up surveillance during the exam period, working with their Interior and Information, Communications and Technology counterparts.
