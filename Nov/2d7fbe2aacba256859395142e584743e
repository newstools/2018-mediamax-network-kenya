Dinah Ondari @dinahondari The Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC) has resolved to summon  Nairobi Governor  Mike Sonko and his Kirinyaga counterpart Anne Waiguru over failure to appear before the committee to respond to audit questions. The duo failed to appear to respond to questions raised by Auditor General Edward Ouko for the financial year  2014/15. Meanwhile, Tana River Governor Dhadho Godhana (pictured) has accused the National government of abandoning counties dealing with emergencies caused by natural disasters. Godhana who was appearing before the National Assembly’s Justice and Legal Affairs committee said most counties have been forced to spend millions of shillings to manage disasters, which is a mandate of the National government. He cited his county, which he said, has over the last one year spent up to Sh220 million in efforts to mitigate the effects of drought and flooding. “The burden is too much for Tana River county. The National government through the funds set aside for contingencies should help us in shouldering the cost,” he said.
