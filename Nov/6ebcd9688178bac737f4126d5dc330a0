George Kebaso @Morarak Kenya is seeking about Sh140 billion of investments to address the numerous challenges facing   coastal towns which are considered key drivers of the blue economy. Speaking during the second day of the ongoing sustainable Blue Economy Conference at Kenyatta International Convention Centre yesterday, President Uhuru Kenyatta highlighted four areas where he has invited willing partners to take advantage and invest in. The Head of State who opened the Governors’ and Mayors’ forum said the first challenge that needs to be addressed is sustainability, a challenge which he added is both clear and urgent. “We need sustainable plans for our cities because in the next few years as population continues to grow in these areas humanity will exceedingly become threatened. We will see a lot of waste spewed into the ocean,” he said. Kenyatta said two-thirds of the global population is expected to live in cities by 2050 and this will put pressure on the infrastructure of coastal urban settlements by extension, beaches and marine resources. “Further, urban areas account for 70 per cent of the emissions that are propelling the planet into a climate unknown. As more people crowd into coastal areas, they put pressure on both land and sea,” he said. Uhuru said in planning the cities, there is need to make them more compact to avoid urban slump and economise on the land under concrete. He said there is need to improve the resilience of communities. “Our grand vision should not be just about building cities and towns, but also creating jobs and liveable neighbourhoods by our communities,” Uhuru said.
