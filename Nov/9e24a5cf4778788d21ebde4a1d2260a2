Irene Githinji @gitshee Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed has urged governments and other stakeholders to mobilise sufficient financial resources and technical expertise required to make quality education a reality for all. Speaking during the launch of Unesco’s 2019 Global Education Monitoring (GEM) Report in Nairobi yesterday, the CS said her ministry is keen to work with all partners and is ready, where appropriate, to coordinate the activities of various actors to optimise educational outcomes. The report shows slow progress in including migrants and refugees in national education systems. The number of migrants and refugee school-age children around the world has grown by 26 per cent since 2,000 and could fill half a million classrooms. The report called for the need to ensure they benefit from quality education. However, Kenya, which is among the top 10 countries hosting refugees in the world, allows them to benefit from its national education curriculum although it’s yet to achieve full inclusion. This is because refugee learners live in camps where they are unable to interact with their Kenyan citizens peers, the report indicates. Amina said despite the challenges faced in catering for refugees, the government is putting in place various strategies to address the group’s educational needs. The strategies include development of a draft policy on inclusion of refugees into the national education system.  She, however, said the displaced and migrant communities exert additional pressure on already strained educational facilities of their host countries.
