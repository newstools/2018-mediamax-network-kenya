Relegated SportPesa Premier League side Wazito FC want an immediate return to the top flight and have earmarked key personnel to help them achieve the target. Having lost coach Frank Ouna to promoted KCB, Wazito wasted little time in finding a replacement in former Modern Coast tactician Mohammed Ahmed who will be assisted by former international Fred Ambani and the management are keen to sign up to 10 players ahead of the December kick off. Speaking to People Sport on phone, club director Solomon Alubala exuded confidence that their ambition was within reach, saying: “We are currently in a restructuring process but our mission is getting our act together and rejoining the premiership. We learnt hard lessons in our debut season in the top flight and we can replicate that by developing a winning mentality. Last season, we were just operating with a patched up outfit but this coming campaign, we know the solution and so an overhaul is inevitable.” Already midfielder Cain Okeyo from Nairobi Stima, right-back Wilson Anekeya from Kakamega Homeboyz, striker David Orem from Bidco United and left-back Washington Munene from Nairobi Stima have been snapped up by the University of Nairobi side. “We just have to go back to the drawing board and in coach Ahmed, we believe we are steady. The transition was very natural given his previous experience as an assistant to Ouna,” added Alubala. Ahmed has promised to play an attractive brand of football that will not only entertain but also win matches. “I believe in attacking the football and my players will have to adapt to my philosophy as this is the only way to bring our confidence back,” he said.
