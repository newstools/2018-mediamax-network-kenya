Kenya Breweries Ltd has launched a campaign to reward Senator Keg consumers in a bid to scale down consumption of illicit brew in Nyanza and its environs. The promotion is set to reward Keg consumers with instant prizes with some riding away brand new motorbikes in a draw. In a 10-week promotion, dubbed “Imarisha Maisha na Senator Keg Reloaded”, the firm will reward 150 lucky consumers with motorbikes and one-year insurance cover each. In addition, consumers also stand a chance to win airtime and cash prizes in daily and weekly draws. Speaking in Kisumu during the launch event, KBL Head of Emerging Beers, Joel Kamau said Senator Keg brand has developed since its introduction 16 years ago. “We are rewarding our consumers for their loyalty over the years and recognising them for their contribution in making Senator Keg one of the most iconic alcoholic beverage brands in Kenya, while at the same time fighting illicit drinks by providing quality beer to all consumers,” he said. Kamau said, backed by a sustainable local value chain from grain to glass, the growth of Senator Keg embodies consistent innovation on the product, how it is served and pricing of the product.
