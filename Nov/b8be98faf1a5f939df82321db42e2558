Chemelil Sugar have loaned out eight players to neighbouring Muhoroni Youth as coach Francis Baraza creates space for more experienced stars. The loanees are Randy Bakari, Ian Ashikoko, goalkeeper Allan Omondi, Kevin Omondi, Kityo Bliss, Kevin Ouko, Nelson Wasonga and Silas Aluvisia. Muhoroni, who suffered two relegations from SPL and NSL in a space of three months, have been on a recruitment drive as they strive to make a comeback but the players are still in the dark as to which division they will feature in when the new season starts. People Sport has learnt that Brian Otieno and Mustapha Odour are set to ditch Nzoia Sugar and join Bandari FC, currently coached by their former tactician Bernard Mwalala, while Luke Namanda and Tom Teka are on their way to Kakamega Homeboyz and Kariobangi Sharks, respectively. Festus Okiring has also been linked to a move to Homeboyz while Elvis Ronack is believed to be heading to NSL side Nairobi Stima. The six players played a crucial role in the club during their debut and second season in the top tier and coach Nicholas Muyoti has a tough job of finding suitable replacements. “We are looking forward to injecting new blood in the team so that we stay a-float despite the exits,” said the former Thika United and AFC Leopards tactician.
