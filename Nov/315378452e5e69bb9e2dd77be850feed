The government was Tuesday assuring that the commuter train service which was brought in to provide alternative transport for commuters following the ongoing crackdown on  rogue matatus will be enhanced. Transport Cabinet Secretary James Macharia who appeared before the parliamentary committee on transport said so far the move has received positive reaction from Kenyans, with hundreds of residents of Nairobi opting to use the subsidized service.
