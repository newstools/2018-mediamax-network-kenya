Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Kenya’s revenue mobilisation still remains a key concern for the government despite improving by 5.9 per cent from Sh345.6 billion for Quarter One of 2018/19 to Sh366.0 billion collected in a similar period in 2017/18, figures released by National Treasury reveals. Concerns remain despite efforts by the government to increase revenue through the implementation of the eight per cent value-added tax (VAT) on fuel – which has seen a drop in petrol and diesel sales by 25 per cent to 255,450 tonnes in September after its implementation, from 338,460 tonnes recorded in August. Figures, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) collection hit 83.5 per cent of the Sh438.3 billion target set by the Government. The ordinary revenue collection from taxes excluding Appropriation in Aid hit Sh332.2 billion against a target of Sh400.9 billion, thus KRA managed to meet 82.9 per cent of the target as per the budget, which was an increment of 3.7 per cent of the gross domestic product (GDP). Total expenditure amounted to Sh452.5 billion, a 9.8 per cent increase from Sh412.3 billion recorded the same period last year. It reflects 90 per cent of the Sh502.9 billion target, with a significant share of the expenditure being on recurrent expenditure, which accounted for 76.3 per cent of total expenditure. Development expenditure only accounted for 18.5 per cent. However, the total expenditure was 10 per cent less than the targeted expenditure as per the budget, an indication that the austerity measures were taking effect. Cytonn Investment Management Plc explained the lower expenditure was mainly attributed to lower expenditure recorded in domestic interest payment, wages and salaries and pension expenditures, which hit Sh19.1 billion, Sh16.1 billion, and Sh9.9 billion, respectively “Revenue mobilisation remains a key concern, with the government managing to meet 83.5 per cent of its target, which is a decline from the 89.1 per cent recorded in the first quarter of 2017/18,” says Cytonn Investment Management Plc Maurice Oduor.
