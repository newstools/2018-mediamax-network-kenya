Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe Siaya Governor Cornel Rasanga’s attempt to mobilise resources to finance his legacy projects failed on Wednesday when the County Assembly rejected a supplementary budget that would have seen reduced allocations to the health sector. MCAs accused Rasanga of being insensitive to residents’ plight, adding that whereas the country was cutting on travel, accommodation and allowances expenses, his government was reallocating money meant for purchase of drugs in public hospitals to finance his “globe-trotting” that had “yielded nothing for the county”. The ward reps warned that he risked impeachment if he does not improve on public resources management. Central Alego MCA Leonard Oriaro accused Rasanga of using area MPs to coerce them to pass the budget. “I cannot imagine reallocating money meant for purchase of drugs to fund non-essential activities,” said Judith Patel, the Assembly Health Committee chair.
