Brazilian superstar Ronaldo de Assis Moreira, commonly known as “Ronaldinho Gaucho” is set to grace grassroots football tournament in his three-day visit to Kenya. Ronaldinho who fired to limelight during the 1998 World Cup, which his country won after putting up an excellent show, is also expected to open a Betika shop in Kisumu. The superstar is also schedule to conduct some mentorship programme to the upcoming footballers in the Lakeside city. The Betika brand ambassador is expected to arrive in the country next week for a three-day courtesy visit to Kenya. Other football stars that have visited Kenya in recent years include ex-Liverpool star Bruce Grobbelaar, Nigerian Yakubu Ayegbeni, Frenchmen Thierry Henry and Robert Pires and German World Cup winner Lothar Matthäus. “He was one of the most super talented in his time  but his warm and flashy smile endeared many football funs  to love him even if they didn’t support his team at the time. His visit will inspire upcoming footballers and allow them to dream big,” said media personality Carol Radull of Radio Africa. The Brazilian is considered one of the most talented footballers and widely celebrated in the history of the game, and certainly of his generation. He enjoyed a stellar 17-year career playing for top European clubs including Barcelona, AC Milan and Paris Saint Germain. He is a World Cup winner and Uefa Champions League champion. Next week Ronaldinho will stage a charity match at Eintracht Frankfurt’s Commerzbank-Arena stadium on November 17. The 38-year-old chose the venue because it was where he won his last major title at international level as a player, lifting the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup as captain after helping Brazil beat Argentina 4-1 in the final.
