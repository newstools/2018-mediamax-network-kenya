Over 500 participants from Kisumu, Homa Bay, Kisii, Nyamira and Migori counties will grace the fifth edition of the Got Matar 10km race in Siaya County this weekend. Athletics Kenya Nyanza region are the organisers of the event and expect a stiff competition especially in the main 10km race which will start from Got Matar Primary and finish at the same venue. Other races that have attracted a sizable number of participants are 400m, 800m and 200m. There will also be the veterans race for the elderly who will battle it out over a distance of 6km while children will try their luck in the 1km event. “We are expecting a huge turn out than the last edition as a good number of runners have confirmed their participation,” said Athletics Kenya Nyanza North branch chairman Joseph Ochieng. He added: “Ezekiel Oduor who won last year’s 10km race will also be here to defend his title.” Ochieng further noted that this year’s edition will also be used to educate young athletes against the use of outlawed substances. Organisers are expecting representatives from the Anti Doping Agency Kenya (ADAK) to conduct tests at the event. “It has come to our attention that most of these upcoming athletes are being lured into these substances unknowingly so we would like to highlight some of the side effects of using these things and the ramifications,” said Ochieng.
