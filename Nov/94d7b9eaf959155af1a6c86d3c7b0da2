Barry Silah @obel_barry Kenya’s bowling was made difficult Sunday as they lost by nine wickets against Denmark in an ICC World Cricket League Division Three 50 over fixture. The Danes had won the toss but selected to field in what was a brilliant display from their bowlers. Their good restrictions only had Kenya finish on 216 all out inside 49 overs. Bowlers Saif Ali Ahmad (4/10) and Jonas Henriksen (3/8) combined for the fall of seven wickets in the innings as Kenya struggled to hit the gears proper. However the duo of Irfan Karim (64 off 99 balls) and Alex Obanda (59 off 80 balls) had half tons to show for on the board but ultimately it was not to be enough under the scorching sun of Al Amarat Oval in Oman. Obanda had six boundaries and two highs as contribution before being stopped on his tracks by Jino Jojo’s tricky delivery which was well timed and caught by Bashir Shah to send the Swamibapa star man to the coolers. Captain Dhiren Gondaria (00 off 02 balls) had a torrid time after going out for a duck in the ninth over. On resumption, the Danes who were previously bottom of the group had their eyes on the 217 target. It was evident by the batting display with man of the math Hamid Shah (105 off 149 balls)executed the first century score of the tournament which included a career high 10 boundaries to his name. It did not help matters that Kenya’s bowling sensationally failed with the Danes losing only one wicket of Taranjit Singh Bharaj (9/27) who was caught out by Sachin Bhudia off speedy Lucas Oluoch’s ball in the eighth over.
