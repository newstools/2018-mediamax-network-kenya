President Uhuru Kenyatta Friday revisited his decision to work with former Prime Minister Raila Odinga and the famous March 9 Handshake. Speaking at the burial of Mzee Peter Musyoka, the father of former Deputy President and Wiper Democratic  Movement party leader  Kalonzo Musyoka at Tseikuru in Kitui county Friday, the President said his unity pact with Raila was for the benefit of citizens. “There will be no more differences and shedding of blood in Kenya. We want a country with a vibrant economy instead of spending five years politicking over nothing,” he said, adding that Raila’s job as the High Representative for Infrastructure Development in Africa will help Kenyans. Raila said their journey to Canaan met bottlenecks on   River Jordan which was infested with Crocodiles.  “The only way out to alleviate the problem was to build bridges.” Musyoka said never again will anyone separate him and President Uhuru. “I will be his spanner boy. Although I will remain in Wiper, the President will decide which direction to follow,” he said. Kalonzo lauded Raila for his the direction he took in building bridges and told him never to backtrack. Deputy President William Ruto called for unity among leaders.
