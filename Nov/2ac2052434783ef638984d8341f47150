As KCPE exam candidates continue to celebrate their results released on Monday,  Diana Kemunto, a former pupil at Joy Town Special School for the Physically Challenged in Thika town is super elated. For Kemunto, who writes with her toes,  completing her primary school level was a dream come true. Kemunto, who hails from Kiserian area of Kajiado is physically challenged and believes disability is not inability. The school’s head teacher Mary Makumi, said yesterday Kemunto performed her best having joined the school unable to write and interpret simple concepts. She said Kemunto’s resilience amidst hardship should inspire parents who hide their disabled children to avoid shame and ridicule from their friends.
