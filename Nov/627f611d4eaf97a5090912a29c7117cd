Riyadh, Thursday Saudi prosecutors said Thursday they would seek the death penalty for five people linked to the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. A total of 11 people were charged, the Saudi Public Prosecutor’s office said, adding that the five people facing capital punishment were directly involved in “ordering and executing the crime.” The prosecution also shared details of the journalist’s murder, saying Khashoggi was killed on October 2 following “a fight and a quarrel” at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Prosecutors say Khashoggi was tied up and injected with an overdose of a sedative that killed him, then his body was chopped up and given to a local collaborator. The Saudi Public Prosecutor’s office added that former Saudi deputy intelligence chief, Ahmed al-Assiri, ordered a mission to force Khashoggi to go back to Saudi Arabia and formed a team of 15 people. They were divided into three groups, it said: a negotiation team, an intelligence team and a logistical team. It was the head of the negotiating team who ordered the killing of Khashoggi, the prosecution said. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu has called the Saudi Public Prosecutor’s statement “unsatisfactory,” reiterating a call for the culprits to be prosecuted under Turkish laws. “They say (Khashoggi) resisted going back to their country and was killed. However, this murder was premeditated as we had announced before,” Cavusoglu told reporters. -CNN
