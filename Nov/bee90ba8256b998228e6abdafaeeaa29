Detectives from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption commission Tuesday raided Migori Governor Okoth Obado’s two homes in Nairobi and Migori  in search of crucial documents  related to the loss of 2.5 billion shillings at the Migori county government. The detectives also camped at Obado’s office in Migori but the Governor who is out on bond in the Sharon Otieno murder case was said to have been away in Nairobi. The detectives are however said to have recorded statements from top officials at the county.
