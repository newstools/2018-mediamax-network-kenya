Migori Governor Okoth Obado now says a plot has been hatched by the  unholy alliance between the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI), and the office of the Director of Public Prosecution(DPP) to frustrate him and detain him without cause. This as the court released him on a 500 thousand bond and a surety of the same amount or a cash bail of 200 thousand after an application to detain him for 15 days for illegal possession of three firearms was dismissed.
