Rodgers Ndegwa in Liverpool @PeopleSports11 Kenyan Opposition Leader Raila Odinga wants sports developed in the country to match the standards in Europe. The former Prime Minister says football development in Kenya will play a key role in ensuring the massive talent in the country is tapped and advanced to match international standards like in Europe and other parts of world. Speaking during a meeting with Gor Mahia players at Liverpool’s Hilton Hotel ahead of last night’s friendly match with EPL Everton, the African Union High Representative for Infrastructure Development who was among the K’Ogalo fans at Goodison Park lauded the players for being the first team in Africa to play an English side on their soil. “We have seen football play a big role in a country and that is why as nation, we should make sure we further it to meet the international standards like the ones here in England. The talented youth can use it to make great strides in their career, hence putting Kenya on the international map,” said Raila, who is the patron of Gor Mahia. He had earlier told the 17-time Kenyan champions not to be afraid of Everton’s pedigree during the match. “Upon hearing that Gor will be taking on Everton, I had to cancel my commitments to be here to witness the historic match as I offer morale and encouragement to the players. I want the team to take the match as any other contest because they (Everton) will be fielding 11 players just like Gor and play 90 minutes as well. This is not a battle between David and Goliath but rather, between David and David,” he added. Raila was accompanied by Siaya Senator James Orengo, Sports Principal Secretary Peter Kaberia, former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth, SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri and Gor chairman Ambrose Rachier.
