Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero yesterday got temporary reprieve after the High Court barred the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) from further searching or evaluating his properties. EACC wanted to evaluate the properties to find evidence of alleged illegal acquisition of Sh213 million public funds when he was Mumias Sugar Company chief executive and later governor. Judge Hedwig Ong’udi issued the restraining orders pending a ruling on a similar matter next Thursday. Kidero sued EACC on October 30 over alleged harassment and intimidation. “The respondents to put on hold any further actions of valuation or entry into the buildings or premises belonging to Kidero pending the ruling on November 6,” ruled Ong’udi. The ruling comes after Kidero’s lawyer James Orengo told the court that the valuation was being carried out by the police in a manner that breached his client’s privacy. “EACC has resorted to intimidating my family members and tenants with raids and searches which are uncalled for. EACC’s tactics are meant to intimidate my family members and make friends and family alienate me which is in violation of my rights,” said Kidero. EACC defended its actions, saying they had written letters to the tenants of Kidero’s properties before conducting the searches but said they did not inform him.
