A mum-of-four filmed strapping flares to the belly of her six-year-old son before a South American cup final, which was suspended after an orgy of violence, has been spared jail. The crazy River Plate fan was identified and arrested hours after the sickening footage showing her allegedly putting her child’s life at risk, went viral. On Thursday it emerged she had agreed to a two-year eight-month suspended prison sentence, after admitting wrongdoing as part of a deal with prosecutors. The woman, whose identity has not been made public to protect her son’s identity, is now back at her home in the Argentinian capital Buenos Aires after a speedy trial yesterday. She will have to do community service and undergo psychological treatment as part of her plea bargain deal, although she has been told she will be able to carry on living with her son and other three children and social services will not take them away. A judge is expected to rubber-stamp the agreement in the coming days. Prosecutors ordered her arrest on Sunday after identifying her by a watch she was filmed wearing on her wrist which they matched to other photos they found on social media.
