Fugitive quack doctor Mugo wa Wairimu was last evening arrested by Flying Squad officers in Gachie, Nairobi, after a 12-day manhunt. Mugo went into hiding after police raided his clinic in Kayole and arrested two medical interns after an expose showed the controversial medic sexually assaulting patients early this month. Medical equipment used for performing abortions were confiscated at the clinic. Yesterday detectives tracked him from Thika suburbs to Gachie where he was found holed up in a house belonging to his cousin. Police sources told People Daily that Mugo had managed to avoid arrest by using more that 15 mobile phone SIM cards and changing his locations. He is expected to be presented in court today.
