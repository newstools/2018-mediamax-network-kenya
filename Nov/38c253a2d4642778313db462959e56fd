Fresh from winning Isaiah Kiplagat Memorial Cross Country in Ndalat Nandi County, Sandrafelis ran a brilliant race, sticking with the leading pack for the first nine kilometres before shaking them off in the last kilometre to win the race in   33:34.05. Sandrafelis beat her training partner, Beatrice Chebet to second place. Beatrice, who is also World Under-20 5,000m champion, clocked 33:47.16 while Antonina Kwambai was third in  34:00:35. In an interview, Sandrafelis admitted that she is enjoying top form and this was part of her preparations for the forthcoming World Cross Championships in March next year in Denmark. “I am currently enjoying top form and I am glad I achieved my target of winning the race. The competition was tough and I had to give it my all especially in the last kilometre,” said Sandrafelis. Beatrice on her part said she is happy to have participated in a senior race and finished second. “I am happy my training partner won the race. We prepared well with her and I’m using the races to prepare for the cross country series as I hope to make  Team Kenya to the World Cross Country Championships,” she said. Both athletes are training in Londiani in Kericho County and are expected to feature in this season’s Athletics Kenya (AK) Cross Country series.
