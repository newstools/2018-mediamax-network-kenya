Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Members of the National Assembly have threatened to impeach Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i (below) over his failure to appear before House committees. The legislators accused the CS of demeaning them and Speaker Justin Muturi to allow them to impeach the minister “as a lesson to other CSs”. “Matiang’i should know that he is not a super CS. The way he is undermining us is not acceptable. We cannot allow the sovereignty of the House to be taken lightly,” said Kiminini MP Chris Wamalwa. His Kisumu West counterpart Olago Aluoch said MPs should tame “rogue CSs” by impeaching them. “Matiang’i needs to honour summons by committees or you allow us to impeach at least one of them,” he said. But Muturi advised the MPs to invoke the Standing Orders and summon the CS and the House would take appropriate action if he failed to appear. “Whenever a CS fails to honour invitations, the committee should make a resolution to have the minister or CS summoned to appear in person. If they fail, then the House can deal with them later,” he said.
