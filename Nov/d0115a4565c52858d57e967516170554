Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league has again been thrown into disarray following the onset of the short October to December rains that have disrupted the fixtures as the league is played at the outdoor Kaloleni Grounds. Last weekend Ulinzi were forced to play just one of their two scheduled matches as the Sunday rains meant their match against Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) could not kick off. If the mid-December target for the organisers to conclude regular league fixtures is to be achieved, the league will have to be moved to an indoor facility. The only available one is Kasarani, as the leagueâ€™s previous venue at Nyayo Stadium is also an outdoor facility. Disrupted fixtures are just some of the challenges the league organisers have had to deal with in the last one and a half years that the Kaloleni facility has hosted the league. Last season came to a close in March as rains often saw weekend matches cancelled all together. The grounds also lack basic social amenities like washroom and changing rooms for players. There are no shades or sitting areas and the fans as well as players have to brave the harsh climate conditions just to enjoy the game they love. This weekend Ulinzi fought stiff competition from Kenyatta University students to register a two-goal win in a 24-22 outcome and move to the helm of the league standings at 28 points. Nicholas Ireri and Kiplagat Cheruiyot scored seven goals apiece while Noah Cheruiyot contributed six to the final score. With the win, the soldiers went ahead of National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) by a point although the millers have a match in hand.
