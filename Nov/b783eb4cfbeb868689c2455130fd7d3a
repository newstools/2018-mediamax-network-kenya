Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho The Kenya shilling remained shaky despite intervention by the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) to prop up the local currency yesterday. This is the second time in a span of one week that the regulator is intervening to prop up the shilling against the dollar. It sold dollars  on Wednesday when the shilling  reached  102.25/35 to the dollar. According to traders, CBK intervened again yesterday, offering dollars directly to banks in the foreign exchange market after the shilling weakened against the US currency. They said the bank also absorbed Sh5 billion ($49.21 million) in excess liquidity from the money markets, using repurchase agreements, which also lent support to the currency, by making it slightly more expensive for traders to buy dollars. “The Central Bank has intervened …even if there wasdemand, it will be catered for by the amount of dollars theyhave sold into the market,” a senior trader from one commercial bank said. The shilling depreciated marginally to settle at Sh102.05 to the dollar yesterday compared to the average mean rate of Sh101.8472 it registered on Wednesday soon after CBK’s intervention. This is the first time in nearly eight months the shilling has depreciated with such a wide margin. Statistics from the CBK indicate that the shilling declined by almost 20.72 per cent per cent from what it exchanged on Wednesday. Analysts attribute the depreciation of the shilling to excess liquidity in the money markets and end-month demand from oil importers and manufacturers. John Kirimi, director, Sterling Investment said the depreciation of the shilling in recent weeks has not been characterised by volatility but suggested it is an issue of underlying fundamentals rather than speculative actions in the currency trading markets. He said the revelation that Treasury plans to borrow another Sh250 billion from the international market to help seal the budget deficit could be the underlying factor.
