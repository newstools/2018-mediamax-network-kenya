The owners of the Sh240 billion Tatu City project are still pursuing the abortive eight-year criminal case against pioneer partners Stephen Mwagiru and his mother Rosemary Wanja. The parent company, Tatu City Limited, and its main subsidiary Kofinaf Company Ltd, yesterday argued their appeal challenging the quashing of the prosecution of the Mwagirus and lawyer Robert Githu for forgery and making false documents. The two firms, which are represented by senior counsel Ahmednasir Abdullahi, are aggrieved by High Court judge Mumbi Ngugi’s decision delivered on November 12, 2013 stopping the two-count indictment against the three on the basis that it amounted to an abuse of the court process. Sole shareholders The trio was alleged to have forged a report by Assistant Registrar of Companies, Wilson Gikonyo, on June 11, 2010 that was used to register caveats on nine prime properties belonging to the firms. The Mwagirus had claimed to have been the sole shareholders and directors of Tatu City Ltd, which was previously known as Waguthu Holdings (K) Ltd, and applied to block any transactions on the land. The judges reserved their judgement until March 8.
