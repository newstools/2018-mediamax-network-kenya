Murimi Mutiga @murimimutiga The Senate Labour and Social Welfare Committee Friday asked the National Treasury to stop delaying disbursement of funds to counties. The committee, which has been on a week-long tour of the Coastal region, said such delays were undermining development. Speaking after touring Kilifi County Assembly and meeting county executives at the Governor’s residence, committee chairman Johnson Sakaja urged Treasury to resolve the issue, adding that many development projects in counties have stalled because of shortage of funds. “We will be addressing the issue next week with the Treasury because the disbursement schedule passed a long time ago,’’ he said. Sakaja, who is the Nairobi Senator, said delay in revenue allocation was hampering implementation of key projects and achievement of the 30 per cent tender awards to youths, women and people living with disabilities. Kilifi Deputy governor Gideon Saburi said disbursement of funds and level of staffing in counties need to be addressed. He, however, expressed optimism that there would be change for better in the near future. Those present included the host Senator Stewart Madzayo and committee members Alice Milgo and Beatrice Kwamboka.
