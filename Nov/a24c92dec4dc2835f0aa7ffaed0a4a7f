A confident Gor Mahia contingent left the country Friday for the high-profile friendly against Everton at Goodison Park, United Kingdom, on Tuesday. A delegation composed of 35 persons left Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) and conspicuously missing in the playing unit are several players who could not secure their travelling documents on time including Innocent Wafula as well as new signings Pascal Ogweno. Clad in khaki trousers, white shirts accompanied by navy blue blazers, each member at the team looked excited as they boarded the Kenya Airways flight. Part of the 27-man team players on board is Uganda Cranes left back Shafiq Batambuze who has just joined the club from Tanzanian side Singida United. Club chairman Ambrose Rachier will serve as the head of delegation. The K’Ogalo will take on the Toffees this Tuesday in a match whose proceeds will be channeled towards charity through the Everton in Community arm. This will be the second meeting between the East Africa club and Everton in a period of one year. In the first encounter played at the National Stadium in Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, in July, 2017, Everton outwitted a stubborn K’Ogalo 2-1 with Jacques Tuyisenge heading home the consolation goal. Gor, who resumed training last week are scheduled to watch the English Premier League clash between hosts Everton and Brighton & Hove Albion on Saturday at Goodison Park. In the meantime, Gor assistant coach Zedekiah Otieno has exuded confidence of the team giving Everton a run for their money. “We’ve been working on our fitness levels after coming back from recess and the progress is good,” Otieno said after a two-hour training session at Camp Toyoyo grounds on Thursday. He added: “We’re confident we will do a good job. This is just a game of football like any other despite the fact that Everton are a good team with players who were at the World Cup.”
