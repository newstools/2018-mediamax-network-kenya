The parliamentary committee on Defence and Foreign Relations has expressed satisfaction over the pace of construction of the Kenya-Somalia border security wall. The committee, which toured Mandera on Thursday to check on the progress of the border security wall, commended the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) which is overseeing the construction of the wall. Katoo ole Mitito, the committee’s chairman, said they were also in a public engagement forum to collect views from residents on whether or not to withdraw Kenyan forces in Somalia. Mandera East MP Omar Sala had petitioned Parliament that residents wanted KDF withdrawn from Somalia due to rampant attacks by al Shabaab. The committee also sought views from residents on the compensation for victims who die from terror attacks in the area. Residents who participated in the forum asked the government to consider ending KDF’s mission in Somalia and deploy the soldiers at the border with Somalia. Residents also said security had improved in the area since the construction of the wall began.
