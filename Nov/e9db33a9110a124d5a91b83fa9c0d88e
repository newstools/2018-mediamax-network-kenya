Farmers from Theta Tea Factory in Gatundu South want the government to crack the whip and ensure that bonus payment is increased next year. Speaking after an annual general meeting at the factory which was largely peaceful, the farmers complained that this year’s bonus payment was reduced by Sh10 which severely affected their operations. They said that tea, which is one of the major contributors to economic growth of the country, should be delicately handled to avert its collapse. Tea is Kenya’s main cash crop earner after horticulture and coffee and pyrethrum. “We have been thinking of increased bonuses but we got a blow after our expectations were reversed by deductions. We educate our children using tea, we feed them using the same but what we saw this year is a shock. We want an increase through establishment of new markets,” said Maina Mworia, a farmer. The farmers said they would not wish to experience what coffee farmers have been grappling with and called on the government to move quickly and salvage the prevailing challenges that have engulfed the sector.
