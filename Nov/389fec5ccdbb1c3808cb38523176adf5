Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Kenya has reiterated its commitment to work closely with other African countries to realise an increased market for its goods and meet President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda. Foreign Affairs Cabinet secretary Monica Juma and her Mozambique counterpart Jose Antonio Pacheco held bilateral talks yesterday on how the countries will enhance trade between them, especially on tourism, blue economy and sports sectors. Speaking during the Joint Commission for Cooperation (JCC), which was attended by experts from all sectors in the two countries, Juma urged the Mozambique delegation to vote for Kenya in its bid to have a permanent representation in the United Nations security council. “We are ready to support Kenya in its Big Four agenda,” said Pacheco.  Further, the two nations discussed their citizens’ free movement, without having to produce a visa, to enhance freedom to travel and do business without obstacles.
