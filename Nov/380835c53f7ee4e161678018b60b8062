Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe Rarieda National Government Constituency Development Fund (NG-CDF) has denied claims area MP Otiende Amollo uses the kitty’s funds to support his “Ondoa Nyasi” initiative. NG-CDF chairman Paul Saoke said the legislator uses personal resources to construct modest houses for widows who refuse to be inherited. So far,  he has constructed 26 houses since the project was launched last year. “The CDF Act only allows implementation of education and security projects and we cannot bend the law to suit interests of one person. The initiative has been a bit slow because its done out of MPs salary but if well wishers can chip in, we can give a smile to more 200 widows seeking help,” he said. CDF manager Jeff Atwenga said  they have inked a deal with Kenya Red Cross Society to inject resources towards the initiative. He said the initiative was started after reports emerged of how inheritors were killing widows  to inherit their property. “Wife inheritance was introduced to help widows build houses, raise children and grow family lineage but inheritors have started behaving badly. Sometimes they even kill to inherit property,” he said.
