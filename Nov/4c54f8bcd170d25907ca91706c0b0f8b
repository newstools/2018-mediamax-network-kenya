Former IEBC chief executive Ezra Chiloba has absolved himself from blame over questionable  procurements at the polls body during last year’s general election terming claims by  chairman Wafula Chebukati as skewed and fetched. Chiloba who appeared before the National Assembly Public Accounts Committee, accused Chebukati of gross interference with the secretariat before and after the 2017 general election leading to unending tensions and confusion at the polls body. Chiloba maintained  that the direct procurement of integrated election management- kiems kits was  a collective decision that was supported by the highest policy level of the commission.
