Sandra Wekesa @PeopleDailyKe Family and friends yesterday gathered to pay tribute to former Nairobi Town Clerk  John Gakuo, whom they eulogised as a great leader and mentor. During the requiem held at All Saints’ Cathedral,  Nairobi, many of his colleagues eulogised him as a dedicated leader who transformed the face of Nairobi city. His children Hannah Wangari, Lawrence Gakuo and Lillian Muthoni praised the administrator for raising them after the demise of their mother through a road accident several years ago. The mass was led by Provost Canon Sammy Wainaina who urged mourners to emulate Gakuo’s good deeds. He highlighted various ways that Gakuo helped the city saying that his legacy will remain forever. “The fact that he died while serving a jail term does not mean he was a criminal. He was paying for the mistakes of others. He was a hero and he will forever remain one in our hearts,” said Wainaina. Former Town Clerk Phillip Kisia said Gakuo was among the great teams that gave its best to reclaimNairobi’s lost glory. Gakuo died at the Mbagathi Hospital where he had been rushed after developing health complications at the Nairobi West prison where he was serving a three-year jail term alongside former Permanent Secretary, Samuel Kirui, former Nairobi city legal secretary Mary Ng’ethe and Chairman of the Tender Committee, Alexander Musee over the Mavoko Cemetery scandal. He will be laid to rest today at his home in Ol Kalou, Nyandarua.
