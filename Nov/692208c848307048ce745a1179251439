County governments have a key role in enforcing the ban on shisha, the Ministry of Health has said in its latest directive to all county public health officers. The ministry is concerned that tobacco smoking in public places is on the increase despite the law curbing the vice taking effect in 2008. In a circular released on Friday, the ministry wants county governments to adhere to a July court directive banning shisha use by helping enforce the directive  following revelations that use of the harmful commodity is still rampant in social places. Director of Public Health Kepha Ombacho said  county governments are yet to enforce the ban, four months since the High Court upheld a December 2017 ruling banning the importation, advertisement, manufacture, promotion or distribution of shisha.
