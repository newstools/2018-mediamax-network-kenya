FOOD SECURITY: Farmers will earn high income in future followi an ambitious initiative by the government and key value chain players to develop a value addition policy. The Ministry of Agriculture yesterday confirmed that a comprehensive policy on value addition will be fast tracked in the medium term and thus opening a new income stream to farmers. Agriculture chief administrative secretary (CAS) Andrew Tuimur yesterday said that the government has a broad plan to develop the agriculture sector. The initiative dubbed Agriculture Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS) is geared towards enhancing 100 per cent food and nutrition security in the medium term. ”Under the strategy’s key components is the development of a value addition policy to enhance the local tea profile both locally and internationally. Only 16 per cent of local tea is value added but in the medium term our intention is increase it to about 30 per cent in order to be at par with our competitors like Tanzania and Uganda,” said Tuimur. He made the remarks during the official opening of the second Africa Tea Science Symposium and Exhibition Nyeri. To allow high value addition, Tuimur confirmed the government is also considering giving incentives to local and international investors willing to place their wealth in the industry. Most of the tea in the country is exported in raw form despite the country being rated as the leader in black tea production. According to the department of international trade, more than 95 per cent of tea is exported in raw form while only less than five per cent is consumed locally.
