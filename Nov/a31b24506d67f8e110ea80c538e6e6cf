KCB’s stranglehold of the Kenya Cup title will come under huge test as they take on new boys Menengai Oilers at the Lions Den, Ruaraka on match day one of the 2018/19 season. The banker went unbeaten last season to underline their supremacy in the local league and their preparedness for another bruising campaign will be put to task by the Oilers Saturday. Oilers’ Kenya Cup debut alongside the return of Mean Machine are the highlights of the new season. The new team are unknown to KCB and the bankers will have to be wary of them since they recently shocked Nakuru in a pre-season friendly. KCB will, however, open their campaign without a couple of top names who are away with the Kenya Simbas side in France for the World Cup qualifiers but head coach Curtis Olago is unfazed. “Their absence is not an issue as we played the Impala Floodlit tournament without them and we had no problem at all. We are always ready to play any side with the players we have,” said Olago. He added: “It is our first meeting and that is the tricky part about it. We are going to play them (Oilers) without knowing their strength nor their weaknesses.” Last season’s runners-up Kabras Sugar will be hoping to go one better this term and begin their hunt against promoted Machine. The 2016/17 season saw one of Kenya’s oldest club (Machine), founded in 1974, relegated after finishing second from bottom but they found the way back and are hoping to stay there for the long haul. The opening matches will also see rivalries renewed when Nakuru head coach Mitch Ocholla face former side Strathmore Leos under coach John Mbai as Homeboyz open their hunt at home to Nondies. Impala will play Blak Blad while neighbours Kenya Harlequins host Mwamba.
