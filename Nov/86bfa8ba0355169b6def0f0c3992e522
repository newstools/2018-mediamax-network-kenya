Kisumu County residents are set to benefit from free medical services this week courtesy of Beyond Zero, an initiative of Kenya’s First Lady Margaret Kenyatta. The two-day medical safari which runs between tomorrow and Friday will be held at Jomo Kenyatta Sports Grounds. Through the initiative, residents  will access various services that include sickle-cell screening, whose selection was informed by burden of disease. Other specialised services to be offered include screening for cervical, breast and prostate cancers, eye care clinic for elderly persons, orthopaedic clinic for children and screening of heart diseases in children. Free Fistula treatment will also be provided at the Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Hospital Referral Hospital from November 17 and 23. “The medical safaris are aimed at providing integrated and specialised healthcare to Kenyans through free screening, treatment and referral services in line with the 2nd Strategic Framework 2018-2022 that seeks to promote holistic services. We encourage the residents of Kisumu to take advantage of this opportunity and turn up in big numbers,” said Angella Langat, the Coordinator, Beyond Zero Secretariat. In a statement, Langat said Beyond Zero will also donate an Abbot Point of Care device to Jaramogi Oginga Odinga Teaching and Hospital Referral Hospital. The technology is set to revolutionise the turnaround time for receiving babies’ results of HIV positive mothers from 30-90 days to 24 hours. Kisumu becomes the second county to host medical safaris after Narok county where more than 5,000 people received health care services.
