A showdown looms between matatu operators  and the Nairobi county government over plans to lock out  the public service operators from the city center beginning Monday next week. The operators have accused  the county government of occasionally coming up with plans to lock them out of the city without giving them alternative sites to carry out their business. A notice issued by the county government, on Thursday says the proposed implementation of the plan is meant to decongest the city centre.
