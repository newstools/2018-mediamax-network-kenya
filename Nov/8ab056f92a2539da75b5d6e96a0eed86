It is D-day for both Thunder and Ulinzi Warriors as the two sides engage in a make or break Game Three tie of the ongoing Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) semifinals playoffs. A win for Thunder will propel them to their maiden finals appearance while a score line in favour of the soldiers will set-up another playoffs as they are trailing the Shauri Moyo based side 2-0. It will be an interesting match as basketball fans wait to see whether Thunder can carry on their good form or Warriors will be better in their defence and delay or even deny Thunder celebrations. Thunder’s coach Sadat Gaya feels that the semis is theirs to lose while his counterpart William Balozi says that they still have a chance to fight for a slot in the final. The soldiers are looking to make a return to the finals having lost to Strathmore Blades 3-1 in last season’s semis to miss the finals. In the other semifinal, holders Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) face off with students Blades, in a repeat of last season’s finals. The two sides are tied at 1-1 in the best-of-five semis series. KPA won Game One 62-54 but Blades turned the tables to win Game Two 69-56. The Dockers are set to miss the services of Daniel Omondi and Martin Kitong’o in Game Three with the former set to return for Game Four while the latter will be able to play in Game Five. The two were ejected during Game One and Two respectively. “There was an element of exhaustion after playing hard in Game One and the players were unable to adjust in Game Two thus the loss. The absence of the two players this weekend is a blow to the team but I am confident we have equally good players for their positions and we will handle Blades,” said KPA assistant coach Mike Opel.
