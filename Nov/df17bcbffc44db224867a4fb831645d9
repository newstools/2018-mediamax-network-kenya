Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Kenyan borrowers will for the next two months get a relief after the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)’s Monetary Policy Committee retained its base lending rates at nine per cent. This is the third time in a row the Central Bank Rate has been retained  since it was reviewed on July 30 to nine  per cent from 9.5 per cent. CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge said in a statement yesterday the committee noted that inflation expectations have remained well within the target range and economy was operating close to its potential. He said in September and October, the overall inflation remained within the target range largely due to lower food prices and muted demand-driven inflation. Food prices According to CBK inflation rate fell to 5.5 per cent in October from 5.7 per cent in September, following decreases in food prices, which offset the increase in energy prices and transport costs following the implementation of valued added tax (VAT) on petroleum products in September. However, the non-food-non-fuel inflation too remained below five per cent, indicating that there were no demand pressures in the economy. He said there was general optimism indicating the economy grew at an average of six per cent in the first half of 2018 compared to 4.7 per cent in same period last year. “A strong recovery in agricultural activity was due to improved weather conditions, continued recovery of the manufacturing sector and resilient performance of the services sector particularly trade, tourism, information and communication, transport, and real estate,” Njoroge said.
