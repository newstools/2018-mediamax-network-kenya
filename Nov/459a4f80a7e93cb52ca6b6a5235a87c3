Steve Umidha @steveumidha Foreigners convicted of fraud-related crimes are being offered ‘celebrity justice’ at Kenya’s Industrial Area Remand prison, People Daily has established. Sources privy to the goings-on at the facility revealed foreign fraudsters mainly Chinese, Koreans, Nigerians, Cameroonian and Rwandese are getting preferential treatment compared to their Kenyan counterparts – with some opting to have their cases heard while in remand, despite being given cash bails. Sources who did not want to be named, said the VIP treatment  includes exceptional meals either prepared specifically for them or ordered from outside, new beddings, phone facilities as well as access to showers and unlimited medical prescriptions thanks to their deep pockets. Kenya Prisons Service, which falls under the Ministry of Interior,  has denied any knowledge of the claims. “We do not allow that in this facility. We don’t do that here.  I am not even aware of such cases. There is nothing extra we are offering them,” said  Assistant Commissioner of Prisons Samuel Ruto, who called the claims malicious and flawed. “Hio ni porojo (unfounded rumours). We do not even do that, who does that? We respect the law,” he said. The remand prison is one of the largest penal facility in Nairobi and regularly hosts capital offence remandees facing murder, fraud and illegal immigration among other charges. But some of the facility officials have used it for money-making, something Ruto refused to rule out, saying the practice could either be taking place ‘quietly’ or had been happening before. “Save for a few things that could be happening under the table, which really cannot qualify such claims…at least for now, if it used to happen before I came, I do not know, I have been here for 10 months now,” he said.
