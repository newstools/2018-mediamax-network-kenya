Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) plans to spend about Sh100 million to host a major global aviation convention next month. Director-general, Captain Gilbert Kibe said yesterday that the 11th International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Air Service Negotiation (ICAN) event will be held for the first time in East and Central Africa. About 600 global aviation experts are expected to attend the event to be held in Nairobi from December 10 to 14. “We will raise the amount with the help of our partners. It is an expensive endeavour in which the country will target to negotiate several air service agreements with 35 partner States, some of them new while others will be renegotiated,” he said while addressing journalists ahead of the conference. Influence policy The announcement comes barely three months after the country played host to another global aviation event in which discussions on improvement on air safety took centre stage. ICAN is an annual global aviation event convened by ICAO since 2008 with the aim of providing meeting facilities for States to conduct multiple bilateral, regional or pluri-lateral air services negotiations in a single location. Kenya is also angling for a permanent seat on the ICAO Council. This will give the country the opportunity to represent 16 African countries and influence policy in the global aviation agenda. Kibe urged the government to position the aviation industry as a critical component in the national development agenda.
