The stage is set for Kenya’s Gabriel Ochieng’s Universal Boxing Organisation (UBO) international bantamweight title defence against Kenneth Kaunda of Uganda at the Treasure Gardens in Kilimani on Saturday. Kenyan wonder-girl Evelyn Odero, who stunned Monalisa Sibanda of Zimbabwe in Nairobi last September will meanwhile slug it out with Mercy Anene in a non-title contest courtesy of Osaga Promotions. “I’m more than ready and if I beat Sibanda, nothing will stop me from administering the same dose to Anene,” said Odero. Ochieng’, who vanquished Ramadhan Kumbele of Tanzania at Impala Club in Nairobi to clinch the UBO, belt has sent a tacit message to Kaunda, saying: ”I dare you at my backyard.” In the big fight, Ochieng’, who has been training at Pal Pal gymnasium under Julius Odhiambo, seems to have a point in his pre-fight assertions,  going by his enviable record. Out of 18 fights, Ochieng’ has won 15, drawn once and lost two. Also on parade will be Jane Kavulani, who has vowed to cut her opponent, Olive Princess Mercy to size, in a non-title featherweight contest. The pugilist, who is under the tutelage of Kennedy “Bisto” Otieno, will be using the fight as a build-up for her WIBA fight against an unidentified opponent in Kakamega in April, 2019. Osaga Promotions Director says all plans for the bouts are complete and has urged fans to turn up in larger numbers. “This will be a big treat for the enthusiasts before Christmas and fans should come and watch what is up the sleeves of boxers,” said Kuya. Weigh-in will be at the venue on Friday at 10am and charges for the fights on Saturday are Sh500 and Sh300.
