Former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero’s wife has petitioned High Court to compel the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to release her documents and items she says the agency seized unlawfully. In her court documents, Susan Mboya claims EACC has failed to comply with Anti-Corruption Court Justice Hedwig Ong’undi’s orders issued on November 8 to release documents and items seized from her and unrelated to the investigations conducted against her husband Kidero. Susan claims EACC has been treating her as Kidero’s appendage. “I am a professional lady of international standing with a substantial income of my own, not just a mere appendage, an extension and or the property of the first petitioner (Kidero), who is a dependent spouse as portrayed in the actions of the second respondent in lumping (Kidero’s) affairs with mine,” she says in her court documents. She says after justice Ong’undi issued the order for some of their items to be returned, the commission only invited her husband Kidero to collect them. Among the documents she wants to be released by the EACC are her will, personal income records and investment mortgage documents. At the same time Kidero has filed another affidavit in court accusing the EACC of sending an unregistered person to value his properties which are under investigation.
