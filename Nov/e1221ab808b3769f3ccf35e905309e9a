Operations at the Sh750 million Ewaso Nyiro Tannery and Leather Factory in, Narok, has finally kicked off. The factory built by Ewaso Ng’iro South Development Authority (ENSDA) is a major boost for the government as manufacturing is one of the four pillars the Jubilee government targets to pursue in its second term for economic growth. ENSDA managing director Sammy Leporos said the factory, which has a capacity to process 13 tonnes of hides and skins per day, will be among the few in the country that process leather. “The construction began two years ago and the factory is now operational targeting to get raw materials from livestock farmers in Narok, Nakuru and Kajiado counties,” he said. “The tannery is well-equipped and we are now doing trials to ensure that all the equipment are operating well and so far all is well,” he added. On human resource, Leporos said they had attained quality technical skills from other established factories in a bid to save on training costs. In the leather industry, the government targets to produce more than 20 million pairs of shoes by 2022, while increasing export revenue to Sh50 billion in the next five years.
