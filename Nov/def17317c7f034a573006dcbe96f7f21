Sandra Wekesa @PeopleSport11 The curtains will finally fall on the 2018 Kenya Premier Chess League (KPCL) when the teams meet for their final round matches this weekend at KCB Sports Club, Ruaraka. A total of  21 teams drawn from Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa will take part in single round-robin format today and tomorrow. The  highlight of the season-ender will undoubtedly be the titanic clash between KCB Group  and defending champions Equity Bank on Sunday that will ultimately decide this year’s champions. KCB are currently leading the chasing pack with 54 match points and 84 game points from 19 matches played, as Equity are heavily breathing down their neck in second position with 50 match points and 72.5 game points but with two matches in hand. Deadly Bishops are in third position on 46 match points and 62 game points, having stayed atop of the table standings for the better part of the second leg, and are poised to clinch third position. KCB team manager Isaac Babu was upbeat about their chances of reclaiming the title they won the previous season. Despite only needing a draw against Equity to do that, Babu authoritatively said. “We have to beat Equity. They have been sneaking on us and this time round there will be no escape route for them.” KCB will be relying on their star-studded team infested with Olympians comprising the Ugandan duo of FIDE Master (FM) Harold Wanyama and FM Haruna Nsubuga, the reigning national champion CM Ben Magana alongside other stellar in Jackson Ndegwa, Joseph Methu, Mehul Gohil, Ben Nguku, Ricky Sang, Martin Njoroge, Ugandan Woman Fide  Master (WFM) Goretti Angolikin, Gloria Jumba and WFM Krishi Shah.
