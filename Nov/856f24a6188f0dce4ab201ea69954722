Butali Warriors have pipped defending champions Kenya Police to top spot in the Kenya Hockey Union men’s Premier League table as the two battle it out for the title in the season’s homestretch. New signings Merteen Fonteyn and Seth Oburu helped Butali to a 2-0 win over Green Sharks at the weekend for 53 points, three clear Police with two matches remaining although the law enforcers have four games sin hand. Both goals were scored in the last quarter for Butali’s 18th win from 20 games as last season’s runners-ups also continue their preparations for the 2018 Africa Cup for Club Championship in Abuja, Nigeria from December 15-22 where they will represent Kenya alongside multiple women’s champions Telkom. Butali must now beat former champions Strathmore in their next encounter ahead of a potential title-deciding final match against Police at City Park on December 9. However, Police can also nick the crown since they have four must-win fixtures unlike Butali who have two. A loss in one of the matches might be catastrophic should Butali win their next two matches as goal difference will see the log leaders crowned. In the other two men’s Premier League fixtures played on Sunday, Strathmore Gladiators edged out Parkroad 2-1 to remain fourth with 29 points, tied with third-placed Green Sharks and fifth-placed Wazalendo as Sikh Nairobi picked a 5-0 win over Nakuru. Sikh’s win saw them leap three positions on the table to sixth and out of the relegation zone with 23 points to leave USIU-Africa (21 points), Nakuru (20 points) and KCA University (19 points) fighting for their lives. In the men’s Super League, Kenyatta University Vultures drew 4-4 with Mvita in a thrilling match played on Sunday. The two sides walked home with four points after each registered a win and a stalemate from two weekend clashes. Vultures registered a 2-1 win over Technical University of Kenya on Saturday with Sunday’s opponent Mvita also beating Kabarak by the same scoreline.
