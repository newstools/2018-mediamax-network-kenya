Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has decried laxity by investigative agencies in arresting and prosecuting individuals linked to the maize scandal. Speaking during a fundraising meeting at Kalalu Catholic Church yesterday, Kiunjuri said he has already forwarded the names of the suspects to the relevant authorities. President Uhuru Kenyatta has on two occasions publicly reprimanded the Cabinet Secretary for allegedly paying cartels and leaving out genuine farmers.
