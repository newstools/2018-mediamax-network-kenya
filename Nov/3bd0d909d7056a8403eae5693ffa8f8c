A group of activists going by the name Umbrella of Concerned Citizens Alliance have called on the Independent Policing Oversight Authority, to investigate the conduct of Capital Hill Police station OCS for failure to act in a harassment case involving the owner of Meladen Restaurant and a private developer. According to the activists,the private developer is responsible for the demolition and destruction of property at Meladen Restaurant a few weeks ago but police, whom the matter was reported to have are yet to take any action. The disgruntled activists are also accusing the OCS of ignoring their grievances despite the owner of the restaurant recording a statement claiming to have received threats to her life. They have further urged Inspector General of Police, Joseph Boinett to assure them of the security of one Dr. Pamela Olet and her business that benefits a large number of people.
