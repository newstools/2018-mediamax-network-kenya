You cannot deny that Mr Eazi has a special bond with Kenya as he recently launched his mix tape; Life is Easy, at Kiza lounge in Nairobi. The Afro pop star walked in at around 11:30pm to an already turned up audience who were enjoying the crazy offers the lounge had as they sang along to the crazy mixes of Dj Guiltybeat from Nigeria. Revellers went into a frenzy when Eazi performed Leg Over, one of his hits under heavy rotation in Nairobi. The event was graced by the who’s who of Nairobi including local deejays Juan, Crème de la crème, rapper Naiboi and radio presenter Shaq the Younging just to name a few. The Akwaaba star also launched emPawa, a new initiative set up with one goal of finding the continent’s next batch of superstars with a mission of uncovering independent and talented artists and providing them with the resources and exposure to launch their own careers. Speaking to PDWikendi he said, “All it took for me to start my career was a video that cost me Sh100,000. That has finally paid off and has allowed me to tour the world, own a business and employ over 100 people in-house and outhouse.” He added that he has funded four videos for artistes and one of them was recently nominated for a BET award which is the ultimate motivation behind the emPawa cause.
