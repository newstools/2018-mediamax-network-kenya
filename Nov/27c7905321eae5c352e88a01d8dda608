Others are Kennedy Kihara, Stephen Kirogo, Dr Joyce Mwikali Mutinda and Samson Kibii. Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet and his two deputies—Edward Mbugua and Noor Gabo— automatically become NPSC members by virtue of their positions. The Constitution mandates the President to constitute a selection panel comprising one person from Office of the President, Judicial Service Commission, EACC, KNCHR,Gender and Equality Commission as well as Association of Professional Societies in East Africa. The Public Service Commission will convene the first meeting of the selection panel, when members will elect a chairperson and later advertise for the job.
