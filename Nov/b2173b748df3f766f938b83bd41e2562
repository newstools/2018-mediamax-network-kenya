A research is being undertaken to determine if there is a link between plastic bags ingested by humans and the rising cases of cancer. National Environment Management Authority (Nema) Director Legal Service Irene Kamunge said plastic bags contained petroleum chemicals that when heated while in contact with food, they end up being ingested by humans. A recent research carried out in an abattoir in Nairobi showed that a single cow had up to eight kilogrammes of plastic in its rumen. Speaking in Eldoret Wednesday during a public participation forum on the proposed plastic bags control and management regulations, 2018,  Kamunge said though plastic bags were illegal in Kenya and have largely disappeared from many parts of the country, they were still being sold in black markets. She, however, stressed that Nema was striving to ensure that plastic carrier bag are not sneaked in from neighbouring countries. “We have learned that some unscrupulous traders usually sourced the banned plastic carrier bags from neighbouring countries and sold them locally which is illegal,” she cautioned. She added that over 300 people have been arrested and charged across the country after they were found in possession of plastic bags. Kamunge said plastic bags would disappear completely when every Kenyan refuses to use them saying the plastic bags were not only harmful to the environment but were also a health hazard. A spot check by KNA revealed that plastic bags are still being used in estates and in the main markets to carry stuff especially in the evenings and at night. Kenya implemented a total ban on single-use plastic bags on 29 August 2017, a move celebrated by environmentalists around the world, she said. In East Africa,  Kamunge noted, Rwanda was the only country that has successfully implemented such a ban.
