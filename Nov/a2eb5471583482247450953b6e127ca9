George Odiwuor  and Winstone Chiseremi @PeopleDailyKe Homa Bay MCAs yesterday continued to make changes in Assembly leadership, saying the move is meant to streamline and sanitise its legislative agenda. The latest changes were made on the Speaker’s panel and the County Assembly Service Board. Acting Speaker Evance Marieba said the changes were made because the Assembly revoked earlier “unprocedural” appointments. He said they also wanted to create trust in Assembly leadership.  “We made the changes so that our members and Assembly staff can feel protected. Those who occupied the offices before were not trustworthy,” he said. The new appointees in the Speaker’s panel include Elias Orondo (Gem East), Geoffrey Anyango (Kabondo West) and nominated MCAs Judith Omogi and Edins Kakach. Juma Awuor (Homa Bay Town East) and Ojala Nyagi (Kochia)are the new members of the Assembly Service Board. The changes came just a day after a fracas broke out when some MCAs blocked embattled Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo from getting back to the office on Wednesday. Ayoo was impeached last week over allegations of incompetence. She returned to the Assembly after getting a reinstatement order from Kisumu Employment and Labour Relations Court. Meanwhile, business has been paralysed at Elgeyo Marakwet County Assembly following persistent wrangles among members. Two factions have reportedly emerged with one group led by House Deputy Speaker Christopher Chemosong (Arror Ward) and another by David Kipketer (Sengwer Ward). The Chemosong wing has 19 members against 14 from the rival group. The division has consequently resulted into a stand-off in the operationalisation of House business.
