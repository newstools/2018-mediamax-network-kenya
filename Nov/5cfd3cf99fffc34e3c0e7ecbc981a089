The Nairobi High Court has sentenced a street boy to four years in jail for killing a friend, identified in court files as an African juvenile, following a disagreement over food. Justice Stella Mutuku ruled that the accused Daniel Muthuri, 24, was guilty of manslaughter on his own plea of guilt and that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that he stabbed the deceased using a kitchen knife and left him for dead. “I have considered the sad circumstances that led to the victim’s death. It was a quarrel over food.  I find that the accused, however, used excessive force and his actions cannot be left unpunished,” she said. Muthuri was charged with killing a fellow street dweller on August 1, 2016, at Transami area in Embakasi, Nairobi. The incident reportedly occurred at a garbage dumping site He is expected to serve two years imprisonment because he has already been in custody for two years since his arrest. The prosecution had told the court to consider the accused person as a first-time offender.
