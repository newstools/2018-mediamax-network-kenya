The government is keen on laying a strong foundation for the seamless operation of Islamic finance in Kenya, the National Treasury Principal Secretary Kamau Thugge says. He said the government would engage various financial sector regulators to finalise the drafting and adoption of the national policy framework on Islamic finance in the country. The PS said this would be done by holding meetings with the regulators to discuss and agree on a comprehensive awareness creation and public education strategy to remove any misconceptions and doubts on the objective of Islamic finance in Kenya. Dr Thugge made the remarks in a speech read on his behalf by Director General, Budget, Fiscal and Economic Affairs, Geoffrey Mwau at a workshop on formulating National Policy on Islamic Finance in Nairobi. He lauded stakeholders for harmonising and coming up with a coherent approach to addressing challenges on issuance, trading and settlement of Islamic finance products and services in the country. “White Papers were drafted for the banking, insurance, retirement benefits and co-operatives sub-sectors. These drafts were reviewed by you, regulators and comments provided,” he told stakeholders. Globally, Islamic Finance represents a small but growing segment of the global assets, with assets held under Islamic finance estimated at $3.4 trillion (Sh350.66 trillion) in 2018, from about $1.7 trillion (Sh175.33 trillion) in 2016. However, in Africa, Islamic finance is growing, with investors, governments and financial institutions increasingly leveraging its potential for both financing and development. “Since 2014, $2.3 billion (Sh237.21 billion) Islamic bonds dubbed “ Sukuk”,  have been issued in the continent, with the number of licensed Islamic financial institutions, rising to over 80 in the last five years,”Thugge said.
