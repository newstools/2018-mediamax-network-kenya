Mismanagement, privatisation of natural water sources and water misuse are the causes of water crisis in Kajiado county. According to a survey conducted by the county government, mismanagement in water firms has resulted in massive corruption, unskilled personnel, huge salaries  at the expense of quality services. Water wars between individuals and companies that claim ownership of natural water sources also contribute to the crisis. The survey compiled in a year showed that only 30 per cent of households are connected to clean water but those accessing the commodity are below 25 per cent. Expose residents Kitengela town was singled out as the most affected, with residents depending on water from  Machakos EPZA, which is rationed, while that from Nairobi goes for Sh70 for a 20-litre jerrycan. Kitengela MCA Paul Matuyia said: “Residents are thirsty and water is becoming the most expensive resource here.” Speaking during Maji awards in Kitengela, Governor Joseph Ole Lenku warned individuals and cartels micromanaging water sources, saying the government is the owner and regulator of natural water sources. “The water shortage, which has tuned into a multi-million-shillings business, is exposing residents to water-borne diseases,’’ he said. He directed that all water bodies be under Kajiado Water Sewerage and Sanitation Company to help address the crisis.
