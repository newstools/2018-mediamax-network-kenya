Fourteen National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) officials are likely to face multi-pronged fraud charges starting with today’s conspiracy to defeat justice and disobedience of lawful orders. The second phase will include unmasking economic crimes offences between NHIF and Webtribe Limited, a firm the agency is alleged to have fraudulently advanced hundreds of millions of shillings. The Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji said NHIF chief executive Geoffrey Gitau and Finance and Investment director Wilbert Kiplagat  are today scheduled to be charged for allegedly denying DCI officers access to crucial documents. “The officers refused to surrender payment vouchers and other books of evidential value in relation to payments for hundreds of millions shillings to Webtribe Limited,” Haji said. Investigators from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations also wants audit and imaging of NHIF servers where alleged falsified claim entries were made. Mwangi and Kurgat were detained at Muthaiga Police Station while others are detained at Pangani Police Station. Webtribe Limited owns JamboPay, an electronic payment system recently emroiled in controversy with the Nairobi County Government. Yesterday, JamboPay boss Danson Muchemi declined to diclose whether he has been questioned in relation to the NHIF probe and the payments received by his firm.
