Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Members of the public can now anonymously raise complaints against rogue police officers after the National Police Service (NPS) introduced an internal reporting system. The Anonymous Reporting Information System, under the Internal Affairs Unit (IAU), will allow citizens to send toll-free messages on 40683 or call 0800721230 after which they will receive a tracking code for their complaints. IAU director Charlton Murithi said the reporting system can also be downloaded as an application on Android phones. “Our vision is to establish an internationally credible IAU,” he said. IAU is an internal department within NPS that investigates the conduct of police officers on their initiative or upon complaints filed by civilians or fellow officers. At the same time, Interior cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i has directed NPS to generate a digital police database to enable scientific tracking of serving officers, those due for a promotion and those exiting the service. The biometric system, he said, will effectively stamp out the vice of ghost workers. The enrollment will begin on December 3 The CS spoke during the launch of the new IAU offices at KCB Towers in Upper Hill, Nairobi. “The IAU as it is today is a culmination of a trajectory of reforms that the president started,” he said. Matangi said harmonisation of police salaries, change of uniforms and implementation of house allowances is on course. “Presidential directives are not negotiated, they are implemented,” he said. Police reforms are spearheaded by a technical multi-agency team chaired by Interior Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho and Boinnet.
