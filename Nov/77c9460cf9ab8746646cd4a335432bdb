This is the right step towards facilitating people to network, and enhancing trade between our nations,” he said at State House, Nairobi. Uhuru was the first to waive visa requirement for Mozambique citizens during his visit to Maputo. Nyusi said Kenya was one of the economic pillars in the continent and promised partnerships, especially in tourism. “Kenya is a leader in tourism and we would like to learn from their model,” he said. To further enhance ties between the two countries, Uhuru said Kenya will next year open a consulate in Maputo to have a full mission.
