Young British footballers could miss out on moving to European clubs because of Brexit. Under current Fifa rules, players aged below 18 years are not allowed to be sold to overseas clubs – except for players aged 16 and 17 moving between countries in the European Economic Area. According to the Telegraph, players like Jadon Sancho would not have been allowed to move if Britain was already out of the European Union. Sancho, who has stunned in Germany and has now been capped by England, was 17 when he left Manchester City for Borussia Dortmund. It is believed that the future eligibility of players moving abroad is a real concern for the Football Association and the Professional Footballers’ Association. There has been a growing trend in recent years for young British players to leave big clubs and move abroad to get more first-team opportunities. If players are stopped from moving abroad it is likely to increase The FA’s determination to introduce stricture rules on overseas players. It has already been suggested that the number of overseas players is reduced from 17 to 13 – although the proposal is not supported by the Premier League. A compromise between the two numbers is more likely to be found. Jonathan Panzo told SunSport in August he moved abroad to get a chance at first-team football sooner rather than later. He said: “It was about opportunity, really. “Monaco is a big club for developing players from a young age and exposing them at a young age.” England boss Gareth Southgate said players can take their game “to a different level” by getting more opportunities earlier than they would do with Premier League clubs. The Telegraph also claims that Brexit would make it harder for Brits over 18 to move abroad. If Britain moves out of the EEA, those moves would become a lot harder to facilitate – many European leagues have work permit rules that mean players must have a certain pedigree to play.  – THE SUN
