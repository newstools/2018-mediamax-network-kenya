Cabinet secretaries Joe Mucheru (ICT) and Henry Rotich (National Treasury) are tomorrow expected to appear before MPs to shed light on circumstances surrounding alleged loss of Sh2.5 billion at the Government Advertising Agency (GAA). National Assembly’s Committee on Information, Communication and Technology want the two to explain how the advertisement tenders were awarded. Committee chair William Kisang yesterday said the committee expects  Mucheru (pictured), who will be the first to appear, to explain the loss of the money and why media houses are yet to be paid for services rendered to the government. “We hope that they will heed the summons so that Kenyans can know what is happening at the advertising agency. It is sickening to hear every other day that public funds are either misappropriated or looted,” said the Marakwet West MP. Besides the CSs, the committee has summoned Principal secretaries Fatuma Mohamed (Broadcasting and Telecommunications) and Kamau Thuge (National Treasury) as well as former Broadcasting and Telecommunications PS Sammy Itemere. Two wives Last month, Lugari MP Ayub Savula, his two wives Melody Ringera and  Hellen Kemboi, Itemere and former GAA boss Dennis Chebitwey were charged over theft of Sh122.3 million  at the agency. They are also facing charges of conspiracy to commit a felony, abuse of office, obtaining money by false pretenses, making a document without authority and aiding the commission of a felony. Savula and his two wives are directors of M/s the Sunday Publishers limited, Melsav Company limited, Johnnewton Communications, the Express Media Group, Cross Continents Ventures limited and Shieldlock Limited which have been accused of benefiting from irregular payments. In 2015, the government established GAA under the ministry of ICT and directed all ministries, State departments and corporations to advertise in it.
