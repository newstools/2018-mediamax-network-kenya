AFC Leopards new coach Nikola Kavazovic has arrived in the country ready to steady the ship of one of Kenya’s giant clubs. Club secretary Oscar Igaida, said Nicola starts work immediately and has been given a free hand to select players of his choice. “Nicola has arrived and we want to urge Leopards fans to give him all the co-operation he needs.  We had a large pool of applicants and we deemed it fit to give Nicola the job due to his rich curriculum vitae. He is at liberty to select players of his choice,” said Igaida. Nikola, who was formerly attached to Township Rollers of Botswana, now takes over the Leopards job to replace Argentine Rodolfo Zapata who has incidentally been contracted by the former club. After a trophy-less season, Ingwe parted ways with coach Zapata who could only guide the team to a 7th place finish in the league standings and a 3rd place finish in the Shield- a trophy they won one year ago under coach Robert Matano. In Kavazovic however, their hopes of not only lifting a silverware but also making huge strides in the continental competitions might be renewed. He is the man who led little known Township Rollers into the Group stages of the CAF Champions League this year. Despite finishing bottom of the Group A, Rollers notched up a memorable 1-0 over Ugandan giants KCCA. In the meantime, Leopards have re-signed defender Joshua Mawira who will be doing his second stint with the team which he plays in 2016-2017.
