It was the most awaited night by reggae fans as Dj Juan performed at Bahama Breeze in Westlands last Saturday for the second edition of Rum, Reggae, and Brunch. As expected, the deejay put in an impressive set, which went down well with the audience. Fans were on their feet basically all night, grooving to Juan’s music mix that fuses reggae, dancehall and roots. Fans were also treated to an opulent Caribbean themed brunch, as cocktails were being served at discounted prices. In attendance were; radio sports presenter Carol Radull, founder of Rum, Reggae and Brunch Zeph Malit and Kenyan based reggae band, Urban Roots Band. Speaking to PD Wikendi, Dj Juan said, “This is just the beginning of startling reggae nights. I’m glad that Kenyans still appreciate reggae music as various reggae music bands are coming up.” He added that he is scheduled to host one of the biggest reggae shows in Kenya that will see a number of Jamaican artists fly into the country and perform.
