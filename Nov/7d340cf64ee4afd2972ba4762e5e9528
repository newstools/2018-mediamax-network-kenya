Gor Mahia is once again in a crisis less than two weeks before they launch their Confederation of African Football (CAF) Champions League campaign against Nyasa Bullets of Malawi. The team, which returned from Everton, England last week, are yet to begin pre-season preparations owing to the fact that no training ground has been booked and the playing unit is also planning a go slow as they are yet to be paid their October salaries despite being promised their dues before travelling to Everton. K’Ogalo will be taking part in the continental competition for the second season in a row and host the Malawian giants in Nairobi on November 27 for the first leg before travelling to Blantyre for the return tie a week later. Gor CEO Omondi Aduda had said on Monday that the team will resume training on Tuesday ahead of the tie. However, People Daily can confirm that the team did not train on Tuesday and yesterday and by the time of going to press, club bosses had not communicated to the technical bench and players about the possibility of training today. Sources within the club confirmed that players have not been paid their October salary. “It is a crisis of sort because things are not moving at the moment. The players want their October salary paid before they begin pre-season training and as a matter of fact, the club management is yet to pay for a training venue,” said the source. “They don’t have a venue where they can train and it is very unlucky that, we are heading into a new season, with the same problems that almost spoiled the 2018 campaign. We only have less than two weeks before we face Bullets and I will not be surprised if they kick us out,” added the source.
