Washington, Wednesday President Donald Trump has hailed a “big victory” in US mid-term elections after Democrats seized the House of Representatives but Republicans consolidated their grip on the Senate. The Democratic majority in the lower chamber will be in a position to block Trump’s legislative programme. But controlling the Senate ensures Trump can still make key appointments. The vote was seen as a referendum on the president, even though he is not up for re-election till 2020. The result confirms a historical trend for the party that is not in the White House to make gains in the mid-terms. The Republicans’ control of the Senate is arguably more significant, says the BBC’s Aleem Maqbool in Washington, because Trump focused his campaigning on Senate races, and candidates he backed clearly benefited. Trump will now feel that his base has endorsed his actions over the past two years, our correspondent says. But even handing over power to Democrats in the House of Representatives may have a bit of a silver lining for the president. Now he’ll have someone to blame if the economy takes a turn for the worse (and, given business cycle realities, it might). He’s got a ready-made explanation for why he can’t get anything done in the next two years – and a pitch for what needs to change in the next election.  -BBC
