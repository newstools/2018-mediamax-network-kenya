Chief Justice David Maraga yesterday launched the re-organisation of the Judiciary but allayed fears of retrenchment and mass transfers of judicial officers and staff. He assured the more than 5,000 Judiciary workers that the exercise is meant to expedite administration of justice, restore public confidence in the institution and promote individual professional growth. “I want to specifically clarify that there will be no job losses. There will only be re-adjustment and movement within structures to ensure the desired optimal allocation of the current human resource outlay in the Judiciary,” Maraga said during the launch of Judiciary Integrated Performance Management and Accountability System at the Supreme Court in Nairobi. “While the recommendations in the organizational review report will result in substantial changes in the institutional arrangements and structures in the Judiciary and the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), the changes have incorporated the entire workforce,” he added. Under the initiative, all court stations and directorates will be restructured for efficient and harmonious operations. A comprehensive human resource skills audit will be conducted and customer care services improved to ensure speedy and efficient delivery of justice.  The judicial reform process was initiated in 2012.
