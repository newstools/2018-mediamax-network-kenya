As Kenya joins the rest of the countries world to celebrate World Aids Day tomorrow, the country is not out of the woods yet in the fight against the scourge. A new report shows girls have disproportionately high rates of new infections PD team @PeopleDailyKe While the country is still grappling with high prevalence of teenage pregnancies among school girls, a new report shows startling statistics on HIV new infections among this demographic. A report prepared by the National Aids Control Council (NACC) has revealed that girls aged between 15 and 24 years contributed to a disproportionate 33 per cent of all new HIV adult infections in the country in 2017. There were approximately 52,800 new infections across all ages, but the highest risk category for new infections is young girls who take a huge chunk of the infections at 17,600 compared to 9,036 men of the same age bracket. Overall, HIV prevalence for youths aged 15 to 24 was 1.98 per cent, which means 184,718 young adults in that age bracket were living with HIV in 2017. Counties with high new infections are, Nairobi (2,587), Homa Bay (1,852), Siaya (1,641), Kisumu (16,30), Migori (1,143), Kiambu (730), Kakamega (596) and Mombasa (562) – which contributed up to 61 per cent of new infections among young people aged 15-24 years in 2017. These figures, however, show a decline in the number of new infections in the same age group from 28,800 in 2010, which is equivalent to a 39 per cent decrease over the period. The report further stated that annual AIDs related deaths among youth aged 15 and 24 years were 2,830 which is about 10 per  cent of the total  Aids-related deaths in 2017. A staggering 54 per cent of these deaths occurred in nine out of the 47 counties namely Nairobi, Homa Bay, Siaya, Kisumu, Migori Kakamega, Nakuru, Busia and Mombasa. While the cause of this vulnerability has not been fully elucidated, expertsthink that it is compounded by structural, social and biological factors. These factors include engagement in transactional relationships, few years of schooling, poverty among others. “Girls have not been raised to assert themselves, especially on issues regarding their sexuality. They do not know how to negotiate for safe sex such as condom use,”  says Lucy Wanjiku Njenga, founder of Positive Young Women Voices, a community-based organisation in Dandora that deals with empowerment of girls and young women affected by HIV. She also reiterated that girls feel the pang of poverty the most. They lack basic necessities such as sanitary towels and so they might get into transactional sex to meet these needs. Dorothy Onyango, CEO,  Women Fighting Aids Kenya, an organisation working with girls living with HIV, blamed poor guidance fromparents and schools for the rising cases of HIV infections. Onesmus Mulewa, Programmes Director of Kenya AIDS NGOs Consortium (Kanco) says introduction of comprehensive sex education in schools could help avert the rising cases of HIV infections among girls. Epidemic Overall, as Kenya joins the rest of the world to celebrate World Aids Day tomorrow, the country is not out of the woods yet in the fight against the epidemic. Kenya still has a long way to go in the achievement of zero new infections, zero Aids–related deaths and zero discrimination. The country has only achieved a 52 per cent reduction in Aids-related deaths (2011-2017). Kenya is also lagging behind in achievement of the global HIV 90-90-90 targets aimed at diagnosing 90 per cent of all HIV infected persons, putting 90 per cent of those diagnosed under antiretroviral treatment and achieving 90 per cent viral suppression by 2020.  Statistcs by Nacc indicates that the current status of the 90-90-90 target is 62-75-77. According to the report, the biggest challenge is on the first 90, which is concerned with HIV testing with men, adolescents and youths recording low levels of testing. The report shows that there has been a decline in overall national adult HIV (15 years and above) prevalence from 5.9 per cent in 2015 to 4.9 per cent in 2017. There was also a decline of new infections from 71,034 in 2015 to 52,800 in 2017. The trend on national prevalence for youth aged 15-24 years shows that prevalence peaked at nine to 10 per cent and three to four per cent in the mid-1990s for females and males respectively. “The prevalence declined to about 3.5 per cent and 1.4 per cent for females and males respectively by 2006 and has stabilised since then among men with a modest decline among females,”  the report says. The overall decline is attributed to scaling up of various prevention and treatment programmes.  Counties from the Nyanza region ranked the highest in HIV prevalence: Siaya 21 per cent, Homabay 20.7 per cent, Kisumu16.3 per cent  and Migori 13.3 per cent. Compared to 2015, these counties, however, registered a slight drop from 24.8, 26, and 19.9 per cent respectively. This year’s World Aids Day will be marked under the theme Know your status, which is aimed at encouraging more people to test for HIV.  According to Unaids, progress has been made  at the global level in the Aids response since 1988, and today three in four people living with HIV know their status. However, there is need to reach out to people living with HIV, who do not know their status and ensuring that they are linked to quality care and prevention services. HIV testing is essential for expanding treatment and ensuring that all people living with HIV can lead healthy and productive lives, protect themselves and their loved ones. According to Unaids several barriers to HIV testing remain. Stigma and discrimination are largely responsible for deterring people from taking an HIV test. Due to fear of testing, many people only get diagnosed after becoming ill and symptomatic. The good news is that there are many new ways of expanding access to HIV testing. Self-testing, community-based testing and multi disease testing are all helping people to know their HIV status. According to the Kenya HIV estimates report 2018, despite the progress made in advancing towards zero new infections, zero Aids-related deaths and zero discrimination there was still a lot of ground to be covered. The report recommends several interventions in the fight against Aids such as voluntary male circumcision, viral suppression, use of PrEP and improved surveillance of new infections.  – Story by Evelyn Makena, Wahinya Henry, Betty Muindi and Peter Ngila
