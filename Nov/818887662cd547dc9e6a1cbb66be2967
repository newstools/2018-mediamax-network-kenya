At the same time, the clerics under the auspices of Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) condemned the recent killing of Kenyan priests in Cameroon and South Sudan. Fr Luke Odhiambo, a Jesuit priest was killed in South Sudan over a fortnight ago while a Mill Hill young priest Cosmas Ondari was shot dead last week in  Cameroon by armed men. Church traditions Bishop Martin Kivuva of Mombasa archdiocese said the bodies of the two will not be flown to Kenya as it is customary with Catholic traditions that priests are buried where they died. He, however, called on the government to ensure through its diplomatic missions that Kenyan priests working in foreign jurisdictions are protected by those States. KCCB chairman bishop Philip Anyolo decried the high number of girls dropping out of school due to early pregnancies. He vowed the Church would not endorse use of contraceptives by pupils and students and instead called on parents to instill morals in children.
