Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) playoffs throw off on November 30 through December 2 and preparations are in top gear for the eight teams that will battle for honours of the 2018 title. Holders Kenya Pipeline (KPC), Prisons Kenya, Bungoma Bombers and Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) will fight for the women’s title as the three teams seek to dethrone the Oilers. In the men’s category defending champions General Service Unit (GSU), Prisons Kenya, Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) will entertain volleyball lovers at the Kasarani Indoor Arena as they search for the gong. Prisons Women, under the tutelage of long-serving national team coach David Lugh’aho and his assistant Josp Barasa will be looking to end their four-year title drought as KPC seek to extend their dominance to five straight titles. Prisons’ finished second after eight legs of regular season matches and produced the best receiver in Mercy Moim and best blocker in Edith Wisah. Despite losing all league matches to their nemesis KPC, the Warders held their own in the various tournaments that were preceded by league matches giving a 50-50 performance against the stubborn Oilers. “We have had time to review our performance and are working on the area that we came up short during regular league matches. We have improved on reception, service and are working on our pairing for various matches depending on intensity. Every team that has made it to the playoffs is good and we cannot underrate any fixture,” said coach Barasa. Barasa’s squad will be boosted by the availability of Jane Wacu who played for the side during the final leg held in Nakuru. Wacu was making a return after her stint with Anse Royale (ARSU) in Seychelles. Also on Barasa’s bench are youngsters Lorine Chebet, a middle blocker and left attacker Sharon Chepchumba who made their debut in the national team, taking part in the World Championship in Japan where Kenya picked her first ever win in the global showpiece.
