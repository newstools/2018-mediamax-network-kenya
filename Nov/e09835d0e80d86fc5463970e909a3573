Kenya needs to give economic reforms priority if it wants to realise its Vision 2030  development programme as projected,” a new study by Oxford Business Group (OBG) says. The study indicates that the country has been undertaking various reforms, which, if given priority, could boost economic growth. It says such reforms include a strong and steady energy mix supply such as hydro, geothermal, solar and wind power. “ The potential for growth across the energy sector includes a diverse mix of sources, ranging from hydro, geothermal and solar to wind power,” the report indicates. The report indicates that Kenya’s change of tact on how to fund projects to boost economic growth through trade initiatives and innovative policies is key, especially when it looks for a business that can provide it with foreign currency. In addition, the report examines the infrastructure development which is underway to help the country to increase trade within East Africa. Other topics analysed in the report include the growing role of Kenya to unify African produce for global export through the Lamu Port-South Sudan-Ethiopia-Transport (LAPSSET) Corridor project and planned regional rail links.
