Yusuf Masibo and Noah Cheploen @PeopleDailyKe A village in Bungoma county is mourning the loss of a girl who was reportedly beaten to death by her parents for spending a night with her boyfriend. There were conflicting reports on reasons for the assault with some indicating that Abigael Namukhosi, 14, from Musangula village was battered for scoring 277 marks and spending the night with her boyfriend on Monday, while others indicated that she scored 400 marks. However, Bungoma North OCPD Stephen Mwoni said the father was enraged after the girl, who had posted impressive results in the just released exams spent the night at her boyfriend’s home. The deceased’s parents are said to have tied her hands and legs with a rope before descending on her with sticks. Mwoni said the girl was rushed to Ndalu Health Center but succumbed to injuries. The mother was arrested and taken to Ndalu Police Station  as the police launched a manhunt for the father who fled after committing the crime. “The mother is in custody and we are interrogating her to establish what went wrong. The father is on the run but  the law will catch up with him soon,” he added. The body was moved to Kiminini Cottage Mortuary.
