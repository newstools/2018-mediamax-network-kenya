PSCU The move by the Presidency to open up State House to children has been lauded as one of the greatest ideas in Africa. Top executives of SOS Chidren’s Villages International on Wednesday told the First Lady Margaret Kenyatta that the idea allows the children to have a personal engagement with herself and the President. SOS Children’s Village global chief executive  Nobert Joachim and the Regional (East and South Africa) Director  Shuba Murthi said the personal interaction between the children, the President and the First Lady has a lasting impact both in terms of mentorship and role modelling. The two SOS Children’s executives spoke at State House, Nairobi when they paid the First Lady a courtesy call. Joachim briefed the First Lady over several global initiatives including the Generation Unlimited programme which he co-chairs with the UN Secretary General, and which aims at enhancing the employment of youth through the development of their skill sets. He lauded the First Lady, who is also the patron of the SOS Children’s Villages in Kenya, for her deep love and interest in the welfare of children. The First Lady said she will continue supporting and working with SOS Children’s Villages for the welfare of all children especially those in vulnerable situations. She also thanked the global body for its continued support for the SOS villages in Kenya. The First Lady also received 100 wheelchairs donated by the Giants Group of Nairobi and which will benefit the Association of the Physically Disabled of Kenya (APDK), Africa Inland Church-Cure (Kijabe) and the Special Olympics Kenya.
