Former Kenyan boxers Congestina Achieng and Suleiman Bilali are ready to return to the ring once they complete their rehabilitation programmes. The two, who were once revered for their prowess in the ring which brought fame to the country, still have the determination to return to boxing and make Kenyans proud once more. Speaking yesterday at the Eden Foundation where they undergo rehabilitation, 41-year-old Achieng said she is now feeling better and is eager to complete her stay and return to  boxing. “There is a big difference between this facility and the ones I had been previously admitted. They have received me well and I can say my treatment is going well. I promise my fans and the country at large that I will return to the ring and make them proud,” said ‘Conje’ as she is popularly known. She added: “I am grateful to the Nairobi county government especially governor Mike Sonko for the efforts they are taking to ensure I get well soon and my focus now is getting better then prepare for a major comeback fight.” Bilali meanwhile, blamed peer pressure for his current predicament. “I am also training hard to make a comeback but I have to first overcome my drinking problem. So far so good because the people in this facility really take good care of us to ensure both I and Achieng come out as victors. I got myself in this situation mainly because of hanging out with the wrong people but I am now doing well,” said Bilali who won medals in Commonwealth and All Africa Games for Kenya at his prime. Eden Foundation Executive Director, Justin Farrar said the two are being closely-monitored and will be at the facility for not less than three months.
