Viden Ochieng and Fred Likuyani @PeopleSport11 SportPesa Premier League side Sony Sugar still want to sign more players despite already roping in six ahead of the 2018/19 season that kicks off next weekend. Sony finished ninth last season and coach Patrick Odhiambo, who has released eight players, wants an improvement in the new campaign especially after a poor start saw them hover around the relegation zone for most of 2017’s first leg. “We have been preparing well and I am optimistic things will improve as we move into the new season,” said Odhiambo. New players Among Sony’s new arrivals is former Muhoroni Youth and Gor Mahia winger Ronald Omino, attacking midfielder Robert Atemo, centre-back Kennedy Owino and defender Appolloh Otieno, all from Tusker, goalkeeper John Njau from National Super League (NSL) side Nairobi Stima, central defender Patrick Ochieng from FKF Division Two side Y-zone FC as well as Ben Mwamlangala. “They are all good players and with them on board, I believe we are a stronger team now,” added Odhoambo. Elsewhere, Vihiga United will unveil their new acquisitions next week, just days before they begin the new season with a home tie against Ulinzi Stars. Speaking to the media in Chavakali yesterday, club chairman Kahi Indimuli revealed that the team is finalising the transfer process before revealing the identities of the new payers to their fans in Kidundu. “The recruitment process is at the final stages and we are very impressed with the work being done by head coach Mike Mururi. For the players who sacrificed for the team and enabled us to stay in the league last season, we want to assure them that they have our trust,” stated Indimuli.
