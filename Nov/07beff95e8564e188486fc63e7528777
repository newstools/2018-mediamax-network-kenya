Budalang’i MP Raphael Wanjala has blamed the National Land Commission (NLC) for the delay in implementation of a Sh10 million World Bank-funded flood project in Lower Nzoia. Speaking to journalists in Busia on Wednesday, Wanjala said the Synohydro contracting company has been on the site since January to kick-start the project, but it has not been able to undertake any work because NLC has not done its part. “This project was supposed to take three years with the completion due in 2021 but Synohydro contracting company has not done anything to date,” he said. He observed that NLC was supposed to survey and value the parcels of land earmarked for the project so that owners could be compensated. “They are now in the process of negotiating compensation with the parcel owners and we want to urge them to speed up their work,” he said. Wanjala thanked World Bank for initiating the construction of dykes but suggested that draining the rivers and streams should have been prioritised.
