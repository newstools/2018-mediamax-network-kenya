Oliver Musembi and Mathew Ndung’u @PeopleDailyKE Kenya is among a number of African countries setting the pace for the continent’s economic take-off, a delegation of investors from Nigeria has said. The investors from Lagos City State who were on a benchmarking tour of Tatu City in Ruiru, Kiambu county, announced they would develop a replica model of Tatu in their country. Delegation leader Teni Zaccheaus who is the chairman of a joint venture between Rendevour who are the lead developers of Tatu and Lagos State said Africa is endowed with land and only needs capital from its development partners to break even. “What we have seen here in Kenya is impressive, the country has the potential to develop even faster industrially and become a regional economic giant,” said  Zaccheaus who was accompanied by Nigerian parliamentarians and other state officials. The team was taken around the 5,000-acre facility by Nick Langford, the Kenya country head for Rendeavour.
