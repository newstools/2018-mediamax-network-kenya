Viden Ochieng and Charles Thuku @PeopleSports11 Kakamega Homeboyz is keen to hold on to their key players ahead of the 2018/19 SportPesa Premier League season amid interest from rival teams. Club chairman Cleophas Shimanyula insists midfielder Moses Mudavadi and striker Allan Wanga, who has been linked with moves to rival teams, are not for sale. Mudavadi, a product of the Homeboyz youth academy, is a key member of the squad who plays regularly and Shimanyula says they have rejected offers for his services before and will do so once again. Wanga had a successful first season after signing from Tusker FC, becoming the club’s top scorer and attracting interest from champions Gor Mahia but Homeboyz are having none of it. “We are not selling the two players. They are both on long-term contracts and we are not going to negotiate with any club. We are assembling a strong team for next season and there’s no way we are going to release some of our key players,” said Shimanyula. Homeboyz have so far brought on board Nzoia Sugar duo of Luke Namanda and David Odhiambo as well as Sosthenes Idah from Thika United. Idah was part of a provisional Harambe Stars squad for the Afcon qualifier against Ghana last month before being dropped by coach Sebastien Migne. The signing of the former Bidco United man, who can play in both central defence and left back, has delighted Shimanyula. “We have signed Sosthenes from Thika United on a two-year contract. He’s a good defender who can play in several positions at the back and we are happy to have him on board,” he said. Meanwhile, Tusker FC has beaten AFC Leopards and Bandari to the signature of Zoo Kericho scoring machine Mike Madoya who netted 14 goals last season.
