Felix Yegon and George Oduor @PeopleDailyKe The government has issued an alert over fraudsters fleecing the public of millions of shillings under the pretext of offering them jobs as enumerators in next year’s national population census. Nakuru County Commissioner Joshua Nkanatha said detectives from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations were trailing suspects who have been posing as officials of the Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) and conning job seekers. Employment right “Every eligible Kenyan has a right to employment in the public service whenever such opportunity arises without bribing or giving out incentives. However, the KNBS has not advertised  jobs with regard to the forthcoming national census,” said Nkanatha. Speaking when he presided over this year’s African Statistics Day Celebrations in Nakuru, the administrator warned that any public servant found to be working in cahoots with the conmen would be summarily dismissed and consequently arraigned. Homa Bay County Commissioner Irungu Macharia also cautioned locals on the scam saying those found spreading such information will be arrested and charged. “People should treat such information as false. The government has not started recruiting officials who will collect data for census next year,”  said Macharia.
