Tom Rachuonyo @PeopleDailyKe Migori Governor Okoth Obado was released last evening after he met all the bail conditions set by the court. Obado paid a Sh5 million cash bail and two sureties of Sh5 million each. He was freed after three weeks at the Industrial Area Prison after judge Jessie Lesiit said evidence linking him to  the murder of student Sharon Otieno and her unborn child was so far only circumstantial. His release has elicited mixed reactions with some residents saying the governor will be able to resume duty. Others thought his release while his co-accused persons are still in custody was “in bad faith”. “How do you think the family of the deceased Sharon will feel when the news reaches them? The courts have not yet given them justice and the suspect should have remained in custody as the case continues,”said one resident.
