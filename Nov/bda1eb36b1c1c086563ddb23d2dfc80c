President Uhuru Kenyatta has reiterated the government’s commitment to recover all the monies  looted from the national youth service and the culprits held liable  in a bid to rid the country  of corruption. Kenyatta who spoke  during the passing out parade of over 16,000 NYS recruits Friday, says the government can no longer tolerate greedy individuals pilfering tax payers money. A clearly agitated president  called  for prudent and diligent utilization of resources allocated to NYS. His statement came as the central bank of kenya CBK declined to reverse the 392 million shillings penalties slapped on five banks implicated in the NYS scam.
