Nairobi lawyer Tom Ojienda risks being locked out from contention for a position in the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) next month over lack of a tax compliance certificate. He is vying for a second term as the Law Society of Kenya (LSK) representative in the JSC. The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has declined to issue Ojienda with the compliance certificate over alleged tax arrears amounting to more than Sh800 million accumulated between 2009 and 2014. In a certificate of urgency filed in the High Court yesterday, the senior counsel is seeking orders compelling KRA to issue him with the certificate ahead of LSK elections. “Unless this court intervenes and compels KRA to issue the petitioner with a tax compliance certificate immediately, the petitioner would be illegitimately locked out of the race in violation of his political rights,” his application reads in part.  The lawyer and KRA are locked in a bitter battle over unpaid taxes.
