Norwich City and Aviva narrowly edged past SportPesa to win Partnership of the Year Award at the prestigious UK Football Business Awards held in London last week. Norwich City and partner multinational insurer Aviva emerged the winner among the nominees for that category that included SportPesa and Hull City FC, Barcelona FC and Beko, Manchester City and UBTECH, Stoke City, the Top Eleven Academy and Everton FC with Blackwell Global. SportPesa was nominated for the award following the successful maiden tour by English Championship side Hull City to Kenya where they played a friendly match against SportPesa Premier League champions Gor Mahia at a packed Kasarani Stadium on May 13. “We were up against some strong competitors and though we did not emerge victoriously, our recognition as finalists for the award is a real honour and reflects all the hard work that we have put in the field of sport and particularly football, with great assistance from all our partners who create opportunities that develop our local football talents,” said SportPesa CEO Ronald Karauri. Karauri further acknowledged the support by Kenyans who showed up in thousands to witness Gor and Hull make history, noting that it is such events that underscore what SportPesa set out to do when it was formed.
