Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) has rolled-out a system which is expected to root out inconsistencies that the authority witnesses while processing Value Added Tax (VAT) refund claims. The system known as VAT Auto Assessment (VAA), which was rolled out on January 1, can detect inconsistencies between purchase and sale invoices declared in the VAT returns and communicate the inconsistencies to both the buyer and the seller. It also raises assessments on the buyer on any unresolved inconsistencies. Acting Commissioner for Domestic Taxes Ruth Wachira said the new system will cross match invoices on iTax by comparing items purchased with those sold. “The system will enhance revenue collection, improve the integrity of data in VAT returns, disallow claims of unsupported inputs by taxpayers and identification of unreported transactions hence broadening the tax base,” said Wachira. She said the system will enhance tax collection as well as enable KRA to refund companies within the shortest time possible. Wachira said KRA is in the process of actualising data driven compliance in line with the transformation agenda. Caxton Masudi, Deputy Commissioner Policy and Tax Advisory Domestic Taxes department deputy commissioner Caxton Masudi, said during the first batch run, about 35,876 taxpayers were affected with the inconsistencies, while 642,557 invoices valued at Sh141 billion were affected. However, during the same period, the unmatched input tax claims worth Sh22.6 billion was encountered. Masudi said previous interventions have so far yielded 1,590 assessments worth Sh3.5 billion out of which Sh1.9 billion has been collected.
