Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji yesterday ordered sleuths to probe rising cases of teenage pregnancies and early marriages in Kilifi and other parts of the country. He vowed to take action once Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) undertakes a comprehensive investigation and establishes the culprits behind early marriages and teenage pregnancies. Saying his office takes children’s cases seriously, Haji assured that he will work with the Judiciary and other agencies to expedite the cases. Fast-track cases The DPP made the remarks in a speech presented on his behalf by Assistant DPP Lilian Ogwora during the launch of Children’s National Service Week at the Kilifi Law Courts. The Judiciary also declared November a Children National Service Month in all court stations to fast-track cases involving children in criminal, civil and those who are victims of crime. Mediation mechanism President of the Court of Appeal Justice William Ouko said all court stations should ensure children cases pending for more than six months are heard and concluded during the service month. He said civil cases concerning children will be settled expeditiously through court-annexed mediation mechanism. The menace was brought to the fore during this year’s national examinations with quite a number of candidates delivering as they commenced the tests.
