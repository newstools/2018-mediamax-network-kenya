Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi A 2017 presidential aspirant has sued Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) for requiring that pregnant candidates and those who have delivered during the examination period sit their papers. Peter Solomon Gichira has filed the petition alongside Faith Nuru and Miriam Mutua. They have named Knec, Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development, Teachers Service Commission and Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed (pictured) as respondents in the suit. The petitioners want the court to declare that the respondents violated the Constitution  by not providing a period of leave for the said candidates. “Even the Employment Act foresees the implication of child birth on a woman and provides three months’ maternity leave  not only for the woman to take care of the new born child but also  for her recuperation,” said their lawyer, Karanja Kimotho, in court documents. They want Knec ordered to set, conduct and administer supplementary national  examinations to candidates who are pregnant, those that have delivered not more than three months before the start of national examination, those bereaved  immediately, before and during examinations  and those that are ill. They argue that Knec is yet to implement policy and procedures to allow for supplementary examinations.
