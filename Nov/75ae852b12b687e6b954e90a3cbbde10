Barry Silah @obel_barry Team X’Ceptions of Gurashish Singh and Patel Kunal, driving a Mahindra Beast claimed the Expert category in the fourth leg of the Champagne 4×4 Challenge at Kipeto, Kajiado County at the weekend. They amassed 1,690 points following minimal mistakes on the mapped tracks, the experienced duo gliding their giant wheeled machine on the heavy rocks under the sweltering heat as they controlled tempo and strategy all throughout the race. “It was an exciting challenge, one that we really liked. A bit of issue here and there but we stuck to the rule book. It is our understanding of the car and each other that made us stand out. We look forward to the next leg in March 2019 and we will be prepared,” said Singh after being crowned the Expert Series 2018 champion. Steve Waiyaki and James Mwai of Team Frame twister finished second in their refurbished Land Rover Defender. Their trial run was characterised by car stability but later on, found their rhythm on the tricky surface. The duo collected 3,140 points as a result of losing balance, reversing and touching on the tape. Third place went to Dipak Kurji and Nikhil Hirani of Team Wazimu who collected 6,500 points in a well-trimmed Toyota Land Cruiser Prado that had power to navigate the route but the pair were crocked by the constant cluttering on pegged marks. In the Intermediate category, Joe Mwaura and Lewis Wanjala of Frame twister stole the show in a Suzuki Sierra, collecting 200 points. The duo was nearly inch perfect in most of their manoeuvres as they navigated around the mapped spots with precision. Siblings Antarjot and Prajbot Saimbi finished second in their elevated Toyota Land Cruiser, picking 240 points in the process. They avoided many pitfalls but could not close the gap at the top with Frame twister. Meanwhile, David Mugambi and Norah Mbithe were declared by the stewards as the drivers of the day while Team Frame twister won the 2018 Championship.
