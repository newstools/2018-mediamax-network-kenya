Dinah Ondari @dinahondari Senators yesterday unanimously supported the County Public Accounts and Investment Committee (CPAIC) report on the Ruaraka land. The report calls for the recovery of Sh1.5 billion paid to three companies for the controversial land. Debate on the report started just as the Powers and Privileges Committee, chaired by Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, cleared three senators accused by Francis Mburu, who claims to own the land, of having demanded a Sh100 million bribe to write a report in his favour. The committee, which was to probe CPAIC chairman Moses Kajwang’ (Homa Bay), Mithika Linturi (Meru) and Kimani Wamatangi (Kiambu) dismissed Mburu’s allegations, saying the documents containing the allegations were submitted outside the period prescribed by the committee. The privileges committee also argued that the affidavits did not substantiate the allegations.  Kajwang yesterday regretted that there were attempts by the individuals indicted in the report to intimidate the committee. “Afrison Export-Import Ltd tried to intimidate the committee by obtaining court orders against being summoned. They also barred media from covering the matter,” he said.  The other companies linked to the matter are Whispering Palms Ltd and Huelands Ltd. However, Leader of Majority Kipchumba Murkomen (Elgeyo Marakwet) expressed reservations for the report, claiming the committee overlooked the role of the National Land Commission (NLC)  and Attorney General in the process of acquisition of the land.
