Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has extended his philanthropic work by pledging to cater for the rehabilitation of ailing Kenyan female boxer Conjestina “Hands Of Stone” Achieng’. Sonko set the ball rolling on Friday after he footed the bill to airlift Conjestina from her rural home in Siaya to Nairobi for immediate  rehabilitation at an undisclosed facility. Conjestina arrived at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) in early afternoon and was accompanied by Nairobi Sports Management Board members including Judith ‘Nyangi’ Anyango, Musa Otieno, Hashim Kamau and Leah Mumo as well as her sister Carol Adala and close family friend Winnie Ogolla. Also at hand to receive the celebrated pugilist were several enthusiasts of boxing who had expressed concern about her plight since she prematurely retired from the game due to illness. Upon arrival, Conjestina was shepherded to Sonko’s private office near Radison Blue Hotel in Upper Hill where Sonko was expected to preside over finer details of her rehabilitation. In the meantime, Sonko further promised that he will secure employment for Conjestina after she undergoes rehabilitation. The impending move is part of Sonko’s deliberate policy to improve the lives of needy Kenya’s sportsmen and women and especially those who have retired in various disciplines. In Conjestina’s case, a video of the once dazzling boxer who was in a sorry state went viral which prompted many Kenyans being touched by her plight. A director at the National Authority for the Campaign against Alchohol and Drug Abuse (NACADA) made a commitment to take the boxing legend to the best facility in Kenya. Several celebrities have also weighed in on the matter saying that people should stop exposing her to sympathy and instead ensure that she gets the help she needs.
