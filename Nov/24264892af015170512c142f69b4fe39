ERRICSON KIPRONO World 800m record holder David Rudisha has lashed out at athletes tarnishing Kenya’s status in the world as an athletics giant by violating anti-doping rules. Speaking during the Athletics Kenya Anti-doping Day held in Iten Stadium, Elgeyo Marakwet County on Friday, Rudisha said he is worried by the increasing number of athletes testing positive on the use of banned substances despite the government’s commitment to fighting the menace. “I am very worried that the number is rising and some athletes are being cheated into using performance-enhancing drugs. We are killing the talent that our fathers and mothers pioneered many years ago by training and running clean,” Rudisha said. Rudisha who is also the Confederation of African Athletics (CAA) president, said the only people who can stop doping in the country are the athletes themselves since they are solely responsible for what enters their bodies. “If today an athlete says ‘No” to doping then we will win the war. It is us athletes who will put an end to it and I want to urge you to compete clean,” Rudisha told the athletes present. Elgeyo Marakwet Governor Alex Tolgos warned chemists in the area who may be involved in selling prohibited substances that their licences would be revoked. He said he would work with Athletics Kenya (AK) and Adak to ensure that the menace is addressed. Athletics Kenya President Jackson Tuwei wants coaches and athletes to name individuals suspected of introducing Kenyans to doping. “You are responsible for anything that enters your body, you should come out and tell us who is doping where and when,” he told the athletes present.
