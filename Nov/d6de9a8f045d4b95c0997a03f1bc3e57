Members of Parliament have this unanimously passed the  controversial Parliamentary Service bill 2018  that seeks to increase their benefits and allowances paving way for  the third reading. The passage of the bill came after Eldas MP Adan Keynan who is a Member of the Parliamentary Service Commission that sponsored the bill,  prevailed on MPs to  support the bill telling them  its for their own benefit. The Salaries and Remuneration Commission,SRC has already expressed its opposition to the bill saying it will bloat the public wage bill.
