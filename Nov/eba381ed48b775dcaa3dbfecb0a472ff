Festus Kipchumba Residents of Kabarnet Town on Friday held a peaceful demonstration to protest alleged harassment by police. The more than 500 demonstrators including boda boda riders, were joined by MCAs led by Kabarnet Ward MCA Ernest Kibet. Among their demands was the immediate transfer of Baringo Central OCS Gabriel Mulei. “We are tired of harassment, blackmail and extortion from the people who have been mandated to provide us with security. The OCS has been a source of frustration to us especially boda boda riders” said Timothy Kiprop a motorbike operator in the town. They further accused the OCS for implementing boda boda traffic rules yet Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i had issued a 30-day compliance period which is yet lapse. Kibet termed the security chief “a tyrant” who did not follow the right procedure when arresting law breakers and appealed to Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to transfer the OCS. Charles Kipkulei, youth leader, accused the police of not following due process during arrests. “Why is it that those who were arrested have never been taken to the court? This means the police are looking for bribes in the guise of enforcing the law,” he noted. Baringo Central MP Joshua Kandie told People Daily on phone that he will intervene on to ensure the demonstrators concerns are addressed. On Tuesday last week, boda boda operators in the town barricaded roads leading to major towns for several hours after police impounded over 200 motorbikes in a crackdown on violation of traffic rules. The police had to use teargas to disperse the youth who were burning tyres on the roads.
