PSCU @PeopleDailyKe A Canadian delegation in Kenya for the Sustainable Blue Economy Conference yesterday said that their country will explore new partnerships with Kenya. The delegation led by Canada’s Minister of Fisheries Jonathan Wilkinson said their country is willing to work with Kenya in exploring new opportunities for collaboration in the maritime sector including maritime security. The proposal was made when President Uhuru held a meeting with the Canadian delegation to thank their country for co-hosting the ongoing Sustainable Blue Economy Conference. The President welcomed the offer by the Canadian delegation and further urged Canada to consider working with Kenya in developing the fishing sector, where Kenya has huge but untapped potential. Hosting conference Uhuru also held a meeting with Sweden’s Minister for International Development Cooperation, Isabella Lövin, who also congratulated Kenya for convening and hosting the conference. President Kenyatta said the conference would act as a stepping stone towards Africa realising its potential in blue economy. The Minister said Sweden was keen in cooperating with Kenya in sectors including renewable energy and social security programmes. The President briefed Lövin on the Inua Jamii programme and invited Sweden to support the intervention. He also held another meeting with Unesco director-general Audrey Azoulay who said that they had brought to the conference a delegation of ocean scientists.
