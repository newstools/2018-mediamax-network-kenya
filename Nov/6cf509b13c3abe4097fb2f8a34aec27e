The government will for the last time bail out cash-strapped State sugar mills to rescue suffering cane farmers, Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has said. He said the government would not just release cash and sit back and watch it go down the drain but would ensure measures are put in place to ensure the intended purpose is achieved. Kiunjuri said despite numerous attempts by the government to bail out some companies including Nzoia Sugar Company, no major strides had been made towards reviving operations, instead, they have kept asking for more funding. He said public millers that would not be able to sustain themselves after the final bail-out would be closed down. The CS said ineffective boards of management would also be disbanded to pave way for selfless managers, who are willing to serve farmers diligently. “The die is cast. All non-performing State-owned sugar mills will no longer be allowed to operate,” he said, adding that the government had dispatched auditors to verify staff records at Nzoia Sugar Company. He said the payroll audit would get rid of ghost workers and suppliers before any cash is released, which will be wired directly to the genuine farmers’ and suppliers’ bank accounts before christmas. Speaking at Nzoia company in Bungoma, Kiunjuri said the country’s sugar and maize industries had been destroyed by cartels, leaving farmers to suffer helplessly. He pledged to rein in the cartels. He was accompanied by Devolution CS Eugene Wamalwa and Governor Wycliffe Wangamati. The government has shares in Nzoia, Chemelil, South Nyanza, Miwani, Mumias and Muhoroni sugar companies. -KNA
