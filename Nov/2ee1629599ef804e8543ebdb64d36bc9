Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) chair George Magoha now wants the government to block the pornographic websites in the country. He said access to pornographic material has greatly contributed to the teenage pregnancy crisis, whose magnitude was exposed during the just-concluded national exams. “I am calling on the government agencies to use the power mandated to them to block pornographic sites,” said the chairman. Speaking yesterday at the Nairobi School where he witnessed the sealing of the last KCSE paper, Magoha also called for the introduction of sex education in the curriculum to curb the epidemic. Sex education He blamed parents for allegedly abdicating their duties and leaving children to their own devices. “Getting pregnant when you are not ready is a sign of moral decadence and negligence from parents,” he said, adding: “I think we, including myself, we have been surpassed by the social media. So can we start to teach these young people about their bodies?” Magoha also took a swipe at politicians for failure to sensitise the public on family planning. “In fact, some of them encourage people to have more children for voting purposes,” he said. On reproductive health education, Magoha said: “I don’t think its outdated to have family health re-introduced in schools.” During KCPE and KCSE exams, hundreds of girls wrote their papers in hospital after giving birth.
