Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission yesterday arrested Bondo Law Courts Clerk Martin Manyala for pocketing treated Sh9,000 to throw out a case. The detectives arrived at the court grounds at around 8am and laid a trap that left the Clerk with Sh9000 in his pocket, whose acquisition he could not explain. EACC Western Kenya regional manager Ignatius Wekesa said he had received complaints against Manyala on several occasions, adding that the latest complaint was received on November 2. “We received a complaint from John Misula, that the Clerk asked for Sh10,000 to drop a case that was before the court,” he said, adding that the complaints prompted his office to set a trap to arrest the suspect. The suspect,  who was arrested in the office of a sitting magistrate in Bondo Law Courts (pictured), is being held at  Bondo Police Station. Wekesa said they are still investigating if Manyala was acting on behalf of his bosses or for his personal gain, adding that the suspect will likely be charged with soliciting a bribe contrary to the Bribery Act. He urged all public officers to uphold integrity, adding that anyone involved in corrupt dealings will not be spared.  “We are in the fight against corruption and we will not let free perpetrators even if caught at the corridors or chambers  of courts,” he said.
