A 14-year-old boy who overcame rejection and abandonment by his biological parents at a tender age to perform well in this year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam is appealing to well wishers to finance his education. Kelvin Kiprop, who was a pupil at ACK Bishop Muge Memorial School, the leading public school in Nandi county, scored 409 marks to emerge among the top students in the region. However, Kiprop is worried that his joy may be short-lived as he risks failing to join secondary school due to lack of school  fees. “My mother left  home leaving my brother and I in the hands of our aging grandmother when I was in Standard Three. I have never known my father since he also abandoned us,” he said. He is currently being taken care of by a family that adopted him take him when he left his grandmother’s home after life became unbearable. “My grandmother is very old and was often unable to provide for us. At times we went to bed without food, and when life became too hard, I went to a neighbour’s house and begged to be taken in,” said Kelvin when KNA visited the school where parents, pupils and teacher congregated to celebrate the school’s good performance. The guardian, Esther Barno, said the boy went to her home one Sunday morning in 2014, armed with a few clothes packed in  a tiny paper bag and requested her to allow him stay in her home so he could play and go to school with her son who was a classmate in a nearby primary school. “I have three other children in university, one in college and another joining Form Four next year and I fear my family may be unable to pay fees for Kiprop,” said Barno, while also appealing to well-wishers to support Kiprop. “He is a disciplined boy, well behaved and has a bright future if he gets support,” she added. -KNA
