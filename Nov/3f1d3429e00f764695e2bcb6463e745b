A Mombasa court Friday denied bond three Chinese charged with offering bribes to detectives probing Standard Gauge Railway-Madaraka Express ticketing scandal. Li Gen, Li Xiaowu and Sun Xin, employees of China Road and Bridge Corporation at the Mombasa Terminus,  denied bribing a Directorate of Criminal Investigations Officer (DCI) with Sh500,000. The are charged with three counts of offering a financial advantage to Inspector Andrew Warui on November 23 at the Mombasa Terminus, in an attempt to influence ongoing investigations in relation to a case of stealing. Chief magistrate Julius Nang’ea ruled that the suspects are a flight risk because they have no permanent place of residence in the country. Further the magistrate said the accused may interfere with witnesses given that they were arrested after attempting to bribe police officers investigating them. They will appear in court  on December 10 for pre-trial hearing.
