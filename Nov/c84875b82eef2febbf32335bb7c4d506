Preparations are complete ahead of Kameme FM’s Ndumo ya Mwaka and Game Tosha launch event at Thika Stadium in Kiambu county tomorrow. The event, sponsored by Mediamax Network Ltd and Game Tosha, a sports betting company, is expected to be the largest event in the country yet. James Kamau alias Sir James, one of the organising officials, said more than 10,000 music fans are expected at the event, which will host local and international musicians in gospel and secular sectors. Tanzania’s Diamond Platnumz and Kenya’s Kelvin Bahati, among others, are expected to perform at the event. “Expect nothing but irresistible fun, we have the best entertainers across Africa who will make your night as you relax after working hard throughout the year,” he said. Kamau said  final touches were underway. High security Thika District Business Association chairman Alfred Wanyoike said almost all hotels in the town are fully booked ahead of the event, adding that business is expected to boom over the weekend. Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has welcomed Kenyans to the event, saying security has been beefed up across Thika sub-county. Event manager Joel Musembe said a lucky winner will walk away with a new Nissan Note vehicle after making a bet worth Sh20.
