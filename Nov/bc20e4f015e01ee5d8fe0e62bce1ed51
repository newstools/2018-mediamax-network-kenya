Alvin Mwangi Mount Kenya region governors have formed a bloc aimed at facilitating economic growth. Speaking after a consultative meeting at a Nairobi hotel Friday, Governors Francis Kimemia (Nyandarua), Ferdidand Waititu (Kiambu), Kiraitu Murungi (Meru) and Muthomi Njuki (Tharaka Nithi) said the bloc’s blue print will help tap the region’s economic potential and will foster economic growth. “As governors of the larger Mount Kenya region we have decided to keep politics aside and instead tap into the potential which our counties hold,” said Kimemia. The economic bloc that brings together the 10 counties from Central region will focus on revitalising the coffee sector, revival of pyrethrum, potato and meat industries, among other issues. “We have decided to minimise the succession politics for now as it’s the high time we brought development to our people as a region,”  said the leaders in a statement. The leaders urged Members of Parliament from the region to support their agenda because it is in line with  Uhuru’s economic blue print of the Big Four agenda. At the same time, the leaders reiterated their support for President Uhuru Kenyatta, who told politicians from the region to keep aside politics and focus on developing the region in Nyeri on Thursday. The Mount Kenya leaders  are divided on the referendum debate, saying they would support a law review that will bring more money to the counties. Kiraitu said if the referendum will take place, leaders should not hype the creation of positions for some people but instead support a referendum that will support devolution. “Our referendum will focus on how resources will be transferred to the counties” he added. The leaders asked Treasury to review how resources are distributed to counties, saying some have been getting massive resources yet they have very low population. The Mount Kenya leaders said they will meet next week to deliberate further on the best methods to implement their agenda.
