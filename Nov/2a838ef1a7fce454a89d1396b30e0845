George Odiwuor Homa Bay Governor Cyprian Awiti prolonged absence from office and the political scene has sparked anxiety. Awiti (pictured) has not been seen in public for the last five months. His absence has been a subject of discussion in social gatherings, with residents demanding an official statement. “No one is explaining what is happening in our county. Where is our governor? We are entitled to know where he is,” said Homa Bay Bunge la Wenye Nchi chairman Walter Opiyo. He said absence of the governor from office has allegedly contributed to laxity in county offices and urged Deputy Governor Hamilton Orata to shed light on the matter.
