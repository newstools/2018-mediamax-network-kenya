Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed yesterday said the country is staring at a national crisis over the high cases of teenage pregnancies. Her remarks came as Teachers Service Commission (TSC) declared it had dismissed 32 teachers for involving themselves in sexual relationships with the students. TSC was concerned that school heads and teachers into whose care children are entrusted with are the ones who take advantage of them. To this end, TSC chief executive Nancy Macharia affirmed it was now taking the matter very seriously and persons found culpable would be dealt with accordingly. She said preliminary investigations show that the magnitude of the problem is far bigger than initially thought. The CS said she has ordered Quality Assurance and Standards Directorate in the Ministry to work with the relevant departments and give a report on teenage pregnancies for further action. They will expand the scope of their analysis to complete the survey in all the primary and secondary schools in the country across a three year period (2016-2018), she added. “I wish to caution the country that the problem of under-age pregnancies must not be viewed as a burden of the Ministry of Education alone. We broke the silence. It is a multi-sectoral challenge that calls for concerted efforts across a broad spectrum of players for it to be stemmed. The law is clear on defilement. And no one is above the law,” the CS said. Amina, who spoke during the release of this year’s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam results, said the Ministry is dealing with the issue and will work with all relevant government agencies to effect the urgent changes required. Macharia said schools should not allow sex pests, even as she said they will be asking other agencies to take up the issue and deal with them as criminal cases.
