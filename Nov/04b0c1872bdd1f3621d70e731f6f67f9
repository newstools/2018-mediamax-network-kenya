National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) chief executive Geoffrey Mwangi (pictured) was on Friday evening arrested by Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) detectives for obstructing investigations into a Sh1.6 billion scam at the fund. DCI boss Geoffrey Kinoti confirmed the arrests of Mwangi and a senior manager in the finance department, who were picked from their offices. NHIF has been on the spotlight lately, amid reports that Kenyans could be paying as much as 5,000 per cent more for medicine and medical procedures in public health facilities. The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) made the damning revelations in a recent report. The price inflations involve inflated bills for patients paying through NHIF for medical procedures. For example, removal of the nasal neck pack, used to prevent the possibility of patients vomiting or swallowing blood after surgery on the nose, costs Sh700 normally but hospitals were reported to be charging up to Sh35,000 if a patient uses NHIF cover. Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki warned that cases of NHIF paying for inflated bills would not be tolerated.
