As Ulinzi chase the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) men’s league title that has been evasive since winning in 2015, coach Yusuf Kipruto says they are ready for the remaining seven matches. The soldiers play Kenyatta University (KU) on Sunday morning before facing off with Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) in the last match of the day. Ulinzi is coming off a 32-26 loss to league leaders National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB). The loss, their first this season has the side trailing NCPB by a point and Black Mamba breathing down their neck at 25 points, one shy of catching up. On their part, KU has blown hot and cold in 12 matches, winning six and losing the rest for 12 points. JKUAT have won eight of their 13 matches and lost five to rank eighth at 16 points. “My players gave their all in the 52-25 win against National Youth Service (NYS) and were fatigued in the NCPB encounter. We have, however, recovered and are prepared for the weekend matches but our focus is largely on winning all remaining fixtures,” said Kipruto. The tactician also confirmed that Nicholas Ireri, Frank Kiplagat and James Regen who had sustained some minor injuries have recovered and will be fully fit for the Sunday clashes. The military side is yet to play two of their toughest competitors Black Mamba and Strathmore University. The two matches will largely determine the placing of the top four teams and Yusuf is optimistic that they will go in their favour. “These are tough matches and if we can pick wins against these two teams we will be in a good position to win the regular league title. We are committed to that and that is one reason we chose not to participate in the East and Central Africa club championship too. I hope we don’t play other teams on the weekends we are to face the said teams,” added Kipruto.
