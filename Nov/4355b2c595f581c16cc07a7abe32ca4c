Dickens Wasonga @PeopleDailyKe ThirdWay Alliance Kenya leader Ekuru Aukot has proposed a single seven-year term for presidents as a way of ending poll-related violence. Speaking in Kisumu yesterday during his Nyanza tour, Aukot (pictured) said an incumbent’s attempt to secure another term was largely to blame for the cut-throat competition witnessed every election cycle, leading to vulnerability to violence. He said the move would also enable a sitting president to focus more on serving citizens and implementing his development agenda without worrying or consolidating support for another term. Akuot said his party supports calls for a constitutional review that will reduce the current structure of government to manageable levels. He called for the reduction of Members of Parliament in Senate and National Assembly to 147 and the abolition of nominated MPs and ward reps. He said only 100 MPs should be elected to the National Assembly with Senate having 47 members, to reduce the burden the public has to bear in paying lawmakers’ salaries. Aukot proposed that a president be paid a Sh500,000 salary while MPs earn Sh300,000. “The president is well taken care of. The State pays for almost everything the president needs,” he said.He said NG-CDF should be scrapped and the allocation to the counties increased from 15 per cent to 35.5 per cent. All development funds from the National government should be channelled to the wards, he added.
