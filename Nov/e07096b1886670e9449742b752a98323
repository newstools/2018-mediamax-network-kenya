Former Cherangany Member of Parliament Wesley Korir has underscored the need to effect the National Sports Fund to cushion cash-strapped federations in the country. “The Fund which was enacted through the 2013 Sports Act ought to be activated as there is a growing list of federations which cannot sustain their activities due to financial constraints. As at now, there are a number of associations which are in debts due to government’s failure to release the funds,” said Korir. Former Boston Marathon champion Korir further called on the government to offer handsome remuneration to the country’s sportsmen and women and especially athletes as they continue flying the country’s flag high in international competitions. “The reason most athletes prefer to participate in foreign meetings rather than say Olympics is that the former attracts better cash rewards. It would be in order if the government comes with a deliberate policy to keep cash incentives high for the best performers,” said Korir. Korir, who lost his parliamentary seat to Joshua Kutuny in the 2017 General Election, insisted he had quit politics and is only focused on his preparations for the 2019 Boston Marathon which he hopes to do well in  after recuperating from a two-year injury layoff. The 2012 Boston Marathon winner is back to full fitness and even took part in the recently-concluded Beirut Marathon though he did not make a podium finish. Besides marathons, Korir said he will also direct his energy towards the Transcend Running Academy which he founded a few years ago in his rural home in Cherangany.
