Thousands of commuters in major towns were left stranded after the government kicked-off a countrywide crackdown on public service vehicles operators who have failed to comply with the stringent Michuki traffic rules. Several operators withdrew their vehicles from the roads while others were impounded and crews arrested as traffic police officers carried out a thorough inspection of all public service vehicles with desperate commuters being forced to walk or seek alternative means of transport to their destinations. The government has however vowed not to relent on the crackdown with the ministry of transport directing the Kenya Railways Corporation to increase the frequency and coverage of the commuter train service warning that operators who hike fares or withdraw their vehicles from the roads will have their licenses revoked.
