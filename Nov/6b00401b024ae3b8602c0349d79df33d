Lynette Matheka Trans Nzoia Falcons won their weekend encounters against Soccer Queens and Spedag to extend their second leg unbeaten run and remain second on the Women’s Premier League (WPL) standings. The Kitale-based side had an easy time against lowly Soccer Queens, putting 16 goals past them to record their biggest win in the league. Against Spedag, the Justin Okiring’s side scored five goals to subject Isaac Otieno’s charges to their 10th loss in 22 matches. Falcons have been the surprise package since being promoted after winning the Division One title unbeaten. They have lost just one match and drawn five. The draws have dented their otherwise perfect run in their debut season in the top tier and are probably the reason a title run has been derailed. He, however, insists that their main focus is remaining unbeaten in the second leg. Poor run “We had done our preparations well knowing what to expect from Spedag and Queens. We were also boosted by the return of Maureen Khakasa, Ruth Ingosi and Martha Amunyolete from national team duty as well as Tumaini Waliaula from sitting her national exams,” said Okiring, who still habours title ambitions. Otieno, meanwhile, admitted that Falcons were the better side in the encounter, attributing their poor run to in-house challenges. The two sides had settled for a 3-3 draw in the first leg encounter. “Our preparations were wanting against such a good side. We have been experiencing some in-house challenges but I hope we can do well in the remaining fixtures and survive relegation then work on getting our house in order,” said Omondi.
