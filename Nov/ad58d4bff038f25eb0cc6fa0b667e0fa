Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The National Assembly was last evening consideringÂ  postponing the much-touted debate on the Constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill 2018 that seeks to implement the two-thirds gender rule scheduled for today. Proponents of the decision to postpone argue that it would allow for further lobbying after it emerged that some members were plotting to shoot it down. The move came after it emerged that the House Business Committee chaired by Speaker Justin Muturi and which comprises Leader of Majority Aden Duale and Leader of Minority John Mbadi, had called for a crisis meeting to determine whether to proceed with the debate. The National Assembly is set to break for Christmas on December 6 until February, meaning should the vote be pushed beyond next week the earliest it can come for a vote is February next year.
