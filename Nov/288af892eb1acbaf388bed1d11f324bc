Demands by MPs to be provided with a new health insurance scheme covering all their wives took a new dimension yesterday after the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC) heeded to their demands and terminated the current scheme. MPs, who did not want to be named confirmed that they are not going to continue  taking medical insurance cover from Liaison Group as brokers and Jubilee as the underwriter at Sh382 million per year. Sources told the People Daily that Parliament could be forced to pay for the termination of the contract that was supposed to run for two years and incur losses for some of the pending bills. And while this was going on, PSC on the other hand, advertised for the provision of medical insurance cover for MPs  for a period of two years. According to the commission, the interested candidates should forward to the commission, completed tender documents marked with the tender number, which should be addressed to the Clerk of the Senate and secretary to the commission. The Parliamentary Service Commission invites sealed tenders from eligible candidates for the provision of medical insurance covers for members of Parliament for a period of two years,” reads the advertisement in part. In the advertisement posted in the local dailies, PSC called for sealed tenders for eligible candidates for the insurance scheme to be received on or before December 11. The PSC decision to look for a new provider comes after MPs at a Speaker’s informal meeting (Kamukunji) two weeks ago rejected the current health insurance on grounds that it is ineffective as most of the members end up paying for their own medical bills whenever they seek treatment.
