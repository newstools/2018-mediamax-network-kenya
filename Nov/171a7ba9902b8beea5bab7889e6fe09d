Interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i has disbanded the Firearms Licensing and Control Board. He said the board would  be reconstituted, adding that the process of reverting all firearms, in view of security and safety, is already underway. Matiang’i said the government has initiated creation of a digital record for genuine firearm certificates and is almost complete. “We have been working quietly in the last few months to create a digital record of all those who hold genuine firearm certificates and the exercise is almost complete and we are issuing new certificates in the process,” he said. He said there are concerns that in the past, licensing of firearms has been riddled with corruption and incompetence in the previous board, sometimes leading to guns being in illegal hands. Speaking on Friday during the orientation of the new Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) board members in Nairobi, Matiang’i said the ministry is conducting a comprehensive audit of the Kenya Police Reserve (KPR) to establish who owns guns to reduce illegal firearms. “In one year, every KPR will be known,” he said.
