Irene Githinji @gitshee The Kenya Conference of Catholic Bishops (KCCB) chairman  Bishop Philip Anyolo (pictured) has been appointed to head the diocese of Kisumu. Pope Francis appointed bishop Anyolo to he position yesterday and will be replacing the incumbent, Most Reverend Archbishop Zacchaeus Okoth who is set to retire. Outgoing Apostolic Nuncio to Kenya and South Sudan Archbishop Charles Daniel Balvo sent an official communication to KCCB, informing them of the appointment. Although Anyolo’s appointment is to take effect immediately, the dates for his installation as an Archbishop and to officially start his new role were not communicated. And before an official replacement is made for Homa Bay, Pope Francis is also expected to appoint an apostolic administrator, usually a Bishop from another diocese. Until the time of his appointment, Anyolo was the Bishop of Homa Bay. Archbishop-elect Anyolo was born in May 1956 in Tongaren, Bungoma county. He was an ordained a priest for the diocese of Eldoret in 1983.  Pope John Paul II appointed Anyolo the Bishop of Kericho in 1995 but was officially ordained in 1996. He worked in Kericho until March 2003 when he was appointed the apostolic administrator of Homa Bay upon the resignation of Reverend Linus Okok Okwach. He was appointed Bishop of Homa Bay in March 2003 and in May the same year, he was officially installed.
