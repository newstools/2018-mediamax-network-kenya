Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe The United States government has donated 12 Bastion Armored Personnel Carriers (APC) to the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) to improve border surveillance. The Anti-Mine Resistance APCs were handed over by US Defence Attaché and Senior Defense Official Col Kevin Balisky to the Deputy Kenya Army Commander Maj-Gen Thomas Chepkuto at a ceremony  in Kahawa Barracks, Nairobi, yesterday. APCs will support KDF’s efforts in the fight against extremists, including the use of improvised explosive devices (IED), along the border region. The vehicles will enhance mobility along the porous Kenya-Somalia boarder where the al Shabaab militants have adopted planting of landmines and IEDs as primary mode of attacks targeting security agents. “These vehicles represent the unwavering US commitment to Kenya and our shared national security interests. As KDF continues to conduct  operations against violent extremism, these vehicles will enhance the mobility and protection of their troops. We are proud to be friends and partners with the KDF as they secure and develop peace in the border region,” said Colonel Balisky. The US is currently providing a three-week train-the-trainer course for Kenya army operators and maintenance of the Bastion APCs. Kenya and the US have a longtime partnership in peace and security especially in the Horn of Africa region particularly in the fight against terrorism. In August when US President Donald Trump hosted President Uhuru Kenyatta at the White House, the two leaders affirmed Kenya and US will continue to work together to grow their partnership in trade, investments and security.
