The 2018/2019 Kenya Rugby Union (KRU long version of the game – 15s season kicks off tomorrow across the three tier leagues with crunch fixtures on the cards. In the second tier league, KRU Championship, six matches have been lined up to usher in a promising and competitive season with top sides Resolution Kisii, Mombasa and former Kenya Cup sides Western Bulls and Kisumu, all-out to fight for two tickets back to the main league. This season’s competition retains its structure from last season where the 12 teams are grouped into two pools of six, each playing home and away fixtures within their pool and a crossover fixture against sides from the other pool before heading into the post-season playoffs. In the playoffs, the top two teams (ranked first and second) will have earned themselves bye and direct home semi-final berths while teams ranked third to sixth will face each other in the quarterfinals, where the team that finish third take on team ranked position six while team ranked position four face off with team ranked position five. Rank One will host the winner of Rank Three v Rank Six in the first semi-final while Rank Two hosts winner of Rank Four v Rank Five in the second semi-final with the winners of the two semi-finals automatically earning promotion to Kenya Cup in the 2019-2020 season. With a host of teams joining the second tier to add more punch to the competition alongside other ambitious teams, the so-called dark horses, it is very likely going to be no business as usual  heading into the new season with more teams pushing harder for the league success and promotion at stake.
