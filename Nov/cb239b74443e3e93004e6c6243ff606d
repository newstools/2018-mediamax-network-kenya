Mercy Salisi Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has warned that all buildings that have not been approved by the county government will be demolished. The governor spoke moments after the owner of a condemned seven-storey building in Kayole was arrested by a multi-agency team led by City Hall officials for allegedly constructing the building without approval. Caroline Wanjiru was expected to be arraigned before a city court yesterday afternoon. “Let this be a warning to those who think they can construct buildings without approval. They will face the full force of the law,” said Sonko. The building was demolished following an outcry on social media about its safety. Wanjiru had been issued with a notice to demolish on November 9 and also ordered to submit its structural integrity report within seven days.
