Central Bank of Kenya’s Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is set to meet tomorrow amid prediction by analysts that policy-making body  will retain the benchmark lending rate at nine per cent. The meeting comes against the backdrop of slow growth of credit to the private sector, weakening of the shilling and relatively stable macroeconomic environment. Cytonn Investment Management Plc predicts that the MPC will leave the base rate unchanged at nine per cent, largely to wait and see the developments in inflation and the exchange rate. Maurice Oduor, a manager with Cytonn Investment Management said of the six factors used to set the benchmark lending rates, one is negative, two are neutral and three are positive, with no change since the last MPC meeting. “We believe the MPC should adopt a wait and see approach, given that the macroeconomic environment is relatively stable. We, therefore, expect the MPC to hold the Central Bank Rate at nine per cent,” he said. Oduor said despite the inflationary pressure expected in the next few months of the year, he does not believe the pressure would be high enough to warrant a policy shift. Since the team met on September 25, the shilling has depreciated from 100.85 units to 102.35 against the dollar, having touched a low of 103.20 along the way on November 16. Oduor attributed the optimism mainly due to a rebound in agriculture, pick-up in private sector economic activity, strong forward hotel bookings, renewed business confidence due to the ongoing war against corruption, and a stable macroeconomic environment.–
