DISPUTE: Central Organisation Trade Union (COTU) has sued multinational tea companies operating in Kenya in the United Kingdom courts for what it termed as “unfair labour practices”. Secretary General Francis Atwoli said the companies which have huge tea plantations in Kericho, Sotik, Nandi hills have blatantly continued to violate rights of workers and court orders. The workers are members of Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union (KAPWU). Atwoli, who is also the Secretary General of KAPWU, said thousands of employees working in tea plantations and factories owned by the multi-nationals mainly from UK were working under inhumane conditions and were being mistreated at work. He said the union has instructed English law firm, Ozone Solicitors, to work with Kenyan lawyers to seek justice for the over 300,000 workers. Atwoli warned the companies to prepare for tough court battles at the UK high courts for being “big headed” and failing to honour court decisions on the plight of thousands of workers in the agricultural sector. “We have instructed highly specialist English Litigation law firm based to work with local lawyers who have been assisting us to seek justice,” said Atwoli during a media Briefing in Mombasa. He said one of the prayers by the union would be for the courts to ban the tea export from Kenya being sold in the Europe. “One of our radical proposal is to urge the UK courts to ban Kenya tea export in the European market until the multi-nationals stop applying unfair labour practices at the expense of Kenyan workers. They should sit and talk with us,” said Atwoli. He claimed that the companies have refused to renew Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) with workers for the last five years ago despite court orders. This is the first case concerning employers taken overseas by their workers, he said, adding that he is seeking international consumer federations’ support for the issue  and add pressure, citing tedious processes in the local courts.
