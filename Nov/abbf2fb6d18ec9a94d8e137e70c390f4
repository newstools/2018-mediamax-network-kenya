Drizzles on the first day of the sustainable blue economy conference being held in Nairobi for the first time forced delegates to avoid visiting stalls set aside by the Jua Kali sector players. The stalls which are selling various commodities including curios, traditional Kenyans clothes, bangles and carvings had to count their losses as delegates walked in and out of Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) in haste. The event which has attracted 10,000 delegates including 11 Heads of state and several heads of government and leaders from the private sector intends to change the narrative of the sector and deepen its productivity and sustainability. Coming from a diverse group of nationals, the language barrier was a challenge but interpreters came in handy, for the event which intends to unlock opportunities worth billions still untapped. For convenience, a secure phone charger with security lock and password was installed at various points to help delegates charge their phones without fear of losing possession. In the past, this has been a bone of contention with delegates losing gadgets while charging them. The Africa Unionâ€™s Integrated Maritime Strategy (AIMS 2050) provides a robust roadmap to fully exploit the potential of its oceans and seas and the first in Nairobi conference is seen as offering African nations the opportunity to solidify this continental framework. Its potential for a continent on which almost two-thirds of its states have a coastline, whose trade is 90 per cent sea-borne and whose lakes constitute the largest proportion of surface freshwater in the world, is enormous.
