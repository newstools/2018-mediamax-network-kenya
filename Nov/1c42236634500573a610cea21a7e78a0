A Kiambu businessman yesterday asked a local court to punish area Governor Ferdinand Waititu for defying court orders barring his government from interfering with the trader’s property. Robert Gathimba through his lawyer Dorothy Nyakiega told Limuru Senior Principal Magistrate Evelyn Olwade the county government had ignored interim orders warning it not to develop his land in Lari until the case was heard and determined. “Am asking the court to punish the county government for continuing to develop the contentious property despite having been issued with orders against the same,” she said. The county government said  it was yet to make any submission because Waititu was out of the country. His case will be heard on November 15 and ruling made on November 19.
