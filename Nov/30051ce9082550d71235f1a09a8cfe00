DPPS @PeopleDailyKe The combat against theft of public resources would be thorough and relentless as the government seeks to elevate Kenya into the upper middle-income country, Deputy President William Ruto has said. He noted that every arm of the Government has to weigh in on the assault against corruption, and “every citizen must play their part” if the country is to develop. “The fight against organised crime, mismanagement, theft and corruption is now running full steam and there are no friends, no relatives and no political sides,” said Ruto yesterday during a forum with Cabinet secretaries, governors and development partners in Nairobi. The meeting, which sought to understand the priority areas of the Big Four agenda, saw development partners pledge to align their strategies to the grand development agenda.
