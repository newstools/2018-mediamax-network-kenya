DP William Ruto has once again called on politicians to shun the 2022 political debate and instead focus on delivering on campaign pledges. Ruto who was in Kakamega instructed agriculture cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri to prepare a list of sugarcane farmers by wednesday next week to ensure the right farmers are paid their dues. This as National Assembly minority leader John Mbadi said he will not accompany the DP when he will be commissioning a government project in Homa Bay.
