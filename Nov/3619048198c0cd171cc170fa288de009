Meru Senator Franklin Mithika Linturi, is reported to have caused a scene at the house of his wife, Maryanne Kitany, defying a court order barring him from having any contact with her. This, despite failed attempts by the family to serve him with the orders, which were issued by senior resident magistrate Orenge on 25th October after she filed for restraining orders.
