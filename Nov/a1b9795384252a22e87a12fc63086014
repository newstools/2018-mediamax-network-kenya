A prominent lawyer has petitioned the High Court seeking orders to prohibit the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) from arresting and charging him over alleged Sh822 million tax arrears from 2009 to 2016. Tom Ojienda, who is a member of the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) claimed, in a certificate of urgency, that the decision to arrest him and prosecute him over the unpaid taxes is illegal, an outright act of bad faith, abuse of office and violates his constitutional rights. “I want the court to issue a conservatory order restraining KRA and DCI from purporting to arrest and charge me over alleged tax disputes,” he said. He further urges the court to grant the orders on grounds that he stands to suffer outright violations of his Constitutional rights if the same is not granted pending the hearing and determination of the petition. The lawyer claimed KRA and DCI are being used to fight him politically, especially after he recently expressed his intentions to run for the Member of JSC-LSK representative. “The sole intention of the intended arrest is purely political maligning and hence the suspect timing of these investigations and pending illegal arrest,” he said. Ojienda claimed that despite a relentless two-year legal tussle of the alleged tax arrears, date he continues to pay taxes diligently and has no other dispute with KRA. KRA had written to Ojienda on June 7, 2016 asking him to remit Sh444 million as total tax due between 2009 and 2016. Subsequently, another letter dated September 5, 2016 referred to as “amended assessment” demanded tax arrears amounting to Sh379 million for 2011 to 2016. The lawyer has since been under investigation by KRA from March 1, 2016. Ojienda said the decision to arrest  and charge him over the alleged tax arrears was on May 18 quashed by Justice George Odunga and the matter is still pending at the Court of Appeal after the respondents appealed the same.
