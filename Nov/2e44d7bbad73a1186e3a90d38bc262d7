Gibo Zachary Thika United and Wazito FC will begin life in the second-tier National Super League (NSL) with away matches against Coast Stima and Nairobi City Stars respectively. Thika found themselves in the NSL after finishing last in the 2018 SportPesa Premier League season, bringing to an end their seven-year stay in the top flight, while Wazito, who were promoted last year, found life tough and went straight back. Both teams will be seeking to emulate Western Stima, who made an immediate return to the top flight after their relegation last year, but it will not be easy since they are already losing some of their star players. Former Kenyan Premier League giants Shabana FC made a return to the second tier after two years in Division One and will have their first assignment of the season away to St Josephâ€™s Youth on December 1. Shabana, alongside Zone A winners Fortune Sacco and Zone B champions Eldoret Youth, earned promotion to the NSL. Eldoret Youth will make their NSL bow away to FC Talanta as Fortune Sacco visit Kenya Police at Karuturi grounds. Ushuru FC, who lost the promotion playoff for a second straight year, will begin another attempt at home to Migori Youth while Nairobi Stima, who missed out on a top-flight place following a late run of poor results, take on Bidco United. Other day one matches will see Modern Coast Rangers host Green Commandos, Kisumu Allstars welcome Administration Police as Kangemi Allstars battle Kibera Black Stars.
