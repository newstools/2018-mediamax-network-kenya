Members of Parliament have vowed to pass the controversial Parliamentary service bill 2018 that will see all 416 members of parliament enjoy a rent-free house, a government vehicle, and an expanded medical cover among other benefits. During debate in the National Assembly Thursday morning, the MPs lamented over the handling of their welfare saying it should be anchored in law. The bill which has been opposed by president Uhuru Kenyatta has sparked -off angry reactions with critics accusing MPs of being insensitive to the needs of the general public.
