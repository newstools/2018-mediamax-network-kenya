Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairperson Wafula Chebukati yesterday narrated to MPs how commissioners were kept in the dark regarding procurement of various tenders amounting to Sh9 billion. Chebukati told the legislators that the Secretariat failed to provide details involving 100 contracts that were entered into in the run-up to the August 8 General Election. According to him, the resistance by the secretariat forced the commissioners to write to the Attorney General to seek legal advice on their oversight duty in regards to procurements. “We did our job but in some cases, we were faced with resistance especially on procurement audit and that is why we commissioned an internal audit,” added Chebukati. He told the MPs that some of the commissioners who have since resigned, namely Consolata Nkatha Maina, Paul Kurgat, Margaret Mwachanya, were opposed to the commissions move to sack chief executive officer Ezra Chiloba. Chebukati was appearing before the Public Accounts Committee (PAC), of the National Assembly chaired by Opiyo Wandayi, to respond to audit queries amounting to Sh9 billion. He claimed that IEBC’s efforts to be informed of how some of the contracts were entered were met with resistance by the secretariat.
