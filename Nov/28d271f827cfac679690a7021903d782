Bernard Gitau @benagitau The government fight against plastic bags use has received a boost after Unilever global promised to eliminate plastic waste by embracing reusable or biodegradable packaging by 2025. Unilever global joins other multinational companies including Coca cola, MacDonald’s in reducing the use of plastic bags and bottles. The Company’s President and CEO Paul Polman endorsed Kenya’s quest to eliminate plastic waste with a support of Sh30 million in the partnership with Mr Green Africa to increase plastic waste collection points across Nairobi. Polman who toured waste management service provider Mr Green in Industrial Area, Nairobi yesterday signed a memorandum of understanding with the waste collector to support a “U-Turn waste project”. “Through this, the company aims to achieve a key sustainability target of creating a circular economy for all its packaging materials, especially plastic,” he added. “The scale of the plastic waste issue is getting worse, not better, with the production of plastics increasing,” Polman said.
