Sunday will witness two of the most entertaining encounters in the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) men’s league when the top four teams clash in what could probably be the season-determining matches. League leaders National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) face off with third-placed Ulinzi while Black Mamba, in second position take on students Strathmore University who are fourth on the log. NCPB and Ulinzi remain unbeaten so far and are separated by one point, the former at 25 while the latter are at 24 points. While the soldiers have had a perfect 12-match winning streak, the Millers’ record is not as perfect as they have played for a draw in one of the 13 matches denying them a two-point lead. On their part Mamba are chasing a 13th win in as many matches while the students will be hoping to clinch their 11th win. The Peter Mwathi-coached side, in addition to hunting a win will be keen not to drop more points seeing that they already lost one match. Prior to the mouthwatering clashes scheduled for Sunday afternoon, Ulinzi play National Youth Service (NYS) this morning while Mamba take on another military side, Tigers, later in the afternoon. In other Saturday matches, Nanyuki play Thika before facing off with The Cruz in another encounter. Boomerang will entertain NYS, their clash paving way for another Cruz show against Thika. On Sunday Kenyatta University play NYS while JKUAT take on The Cruz. Technical University play Generation in another match while Tigers’ match against St Paul paves way for the two super clashes where the Ulinzi versus NCPB match will precede the other encounter.
