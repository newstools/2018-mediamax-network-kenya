Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe A Chief Inspector of Police attached to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) has been arrested after he allegedly fatally shot a colleague. Duncan Maina, who is claimed to have killed deceased during a scuffle over a government vehicle in Thindigua, Kaimbu county, was  disarmed and arrested on Friday. The incident is said to have happened when Police Constable Evanson Kipngetich Busienei stopped Maina and asked him to hand over a vehicle to him. An agitated Maina reportedly stopped the vehicle and threatened to shoot Busienei. He then drew his firearm and shot him twice at close range, killing him instantly. The officer then shot at another person who was walking alongside Busienei but missed him. On Friday, homicide detectives seized the Czeska pistol and a Scorpion SMG serial number KP C181213 and a magazine of 30 rounds of ammunition as exhibits. The pistol had one bullet in the chamber, two magazines one of 14 rounds of ammunition and the other five rounds of ammunition of 9mm caliber. There is a growing concern in the National Police Service over rising cases of killings and suicides involving police officers.
