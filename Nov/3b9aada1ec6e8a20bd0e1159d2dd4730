Fred Aminga @faminga Kenya is set to co-host the United Nations Ocean’s Conference, with Portugal in June 2020 after the ongoing sustainable blue economy conference in Nairobi. The oceans conference will feature action-oriented discussions pertaining to sustainable economic strategies which are people-centric, with ocean-centric investments. As the single largest natural asset on the planet which represents some 99 per cent of the earth’s living volume, the ocean delivers numerous benefits to humanity and is responsible for the oxygen in every other breath we take. It supplies 15 per cent of humanity’s protein needs. It also serves as the highway for some 90 per cent of internationally traded goods, through the shipping sector. Foreign Affairs Principal Secretary Macharia Kamau said this makes the ongoing conference a preparatory move to the 2020 Ocean’s Conference. “We are part of a global family and as you know Kenya will be hosting in 2020 the United Nations Oceans Conference. We have partnered with Portugal and it is actually going to take place in Lisbon so much of what is happening here is going to feed into the United Nations process,” he said. Innovative stakeholders This show the government’s intent in making the blue economy successful calling for innovative stakeholders, including national and local governments, the private sector, civil society, regional and sub-regional groups as well as domestic and international financial institutions to invest and formulate sustainable ways of exploiting the ocean economy. The submission of voluntary commitments was a special effort to establish commitments, that will contribute to the implementation of Goal 14, to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources under Kenya’s jurisdiction and beyond, through meaningful partnerships with other States.
