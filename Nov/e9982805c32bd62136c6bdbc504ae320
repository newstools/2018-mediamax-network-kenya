National Social Security Fund (NSSF) men’s Karate team asserted their supremacy, winning two titles out of four at the Kenya Karate Federation (KKF) National Inter-Club championship that ended at the Kenya Medical Training College Busia Campus. The kata team retained the title after thrashing Prisons5-0 in the final with James Gikonyo, David Kimani and Jeremia Mugweru leading the onslaught to clinch gold. Menengai from Nakuru were contented with bronze medals. NSSF kumite team won back-to-back titles; relegating Prisons to second place while Administration Police Training College took third position. NSSF Ladies team failed to emulate their male counterparts. In Kata, NSSF were beaten 4-1 by Menengai to claim their maiden title which was held by Jomo Kenyatta University of Arts and Technology that failed to defend the title.  Mully Children’s Family (MCF) from Machakos took third position. MCF bounced back to claim the Kumite crown after beating NSSF in the final. Maseno from Nyanza took third position in the event that attracted 15 clubs including seven for ladies. A Standard Seven pupil from Ebenezer Academy in Busia County Crenald Otieno exhibited his prowess in the Shotokan Kata-Sochin display that thrilled participants including former All Africa Games silver medallist Obisa Wanyama. KKF Western branch chairman Augustine Okechi urged county governments in the region to support the martial art which he says is not related to thuggery or political agendas but it promotes discipline among participants. “Busia has produced world beaters including former Members of the County Assembly Obisa Wanyama and Solomon Onyango. At no single time did I hear them engage in undisciplined behaviour,” he said.
