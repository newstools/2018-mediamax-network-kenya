The Chief of Defence Forces General Samson Mwathethe has warned fraudsters against using next week’s recruitment drive to con members of the public. He has also cautioned Kenyans against falling for such tricksters, saying those who will try to bribe their way into the Kenya Defence Forces will   lose their money and be prosecuted. “KDF recruitment is absolutely free to all. If you accept to be conned, you will lose your money or property and go to jail; it has happened to many citizens during past recruitments. Do not waste money and risk imprisonment. No one can influence the recruitment process,” Mwathethe said. Calling letters KDF will carry out a month-long recruitment drive beginning next week and end on December 19. The exercise will be conducted in all the 47 counties between 8am and 6pm during weekdays only. Mwathethe said any person purporting to recruit/issue calling letters away from recruitment centres is a fraudster. The candidates are expected to produce original National Identity card and academic certificates or testimonials.
