George Odiwuor Homa Bay County Assembly Leader of Majority Walter Muok and Central Karachuonyo MCA Julius Gaya were arrested on Thursday over alleged assault of embattled Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo a month ago. This came after Ayoo recorded a statement at Kisumu Police Station. Gaya was first taken to Kendu Bay Police Station in Rachuonyo North while Muok was taken to Homa Bay Police Station after their arrests before they were both transferred to Nyanza Regional CID headquarters in Kisumu. Speaking on the phone, Gaya said he had no idea why he was being taken to Kisumu for interrogation. “I don’t know why I am in police custody in Kisumu while the alleged offence was committed in Homa Bay,” he said. Homa Bay Directorate of Criminal Investigations Commander Daniel Wachira said:  “We have handed them to our colleagues in Kisumu.” At the same time, seven other MCAs reported to Nyanza CID headquarters after being informed that police were seeking them for questioning over the alleged assault on Ayoo. The seven are acting Speaker Evans Marieba, Philemon Onditi (Kagan), Dan Were (Kakelo Kokwanyo), Paul Wamunga (North Karachuonyo), Godfrey Anyango (Kabondo West), Paul Adika (Lambwe) and Peter Kaula (Wang’chieng’). There have been wrangles at the Assembly over the Speaker and the Leader of Majority positions.
