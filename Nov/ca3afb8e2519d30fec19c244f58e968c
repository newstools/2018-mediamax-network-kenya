The National Assembly has once again pushed itself on the precipice of being dissolved after MPs deferred a vote on the controversial gender equity bill after failing to raise the requisite 233 MPs to pass the bill. The much anticipated vote was shelved following a request by leader of majority Aden Duale during a session attended by opposition leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka. The house business committee has been tasked with the mandate of coming up with a new date for the vote with women MPs expressing confidence that they will marshall the required numbers.
