James Magayi @magayijim Kenya’s representatives to 2018/2018 continental club championships Gor Mahia and Kariobangi Sharks’ (pictured) anxiety to find out their opponents will persist further after Confederation of African Football (CAF) Inter Clubs Committee failed to make the draws public in Rabat, Morocco, on Saturday. CAF is said to be mulling changes to the continental club championships which need the go-ahead from upper echelons of the organizations and might take a few more days. CAF’s failure to release the draws coupled with loud silence drew a lot of condemnation all over the country with speculation flying around and what may be going on. The organisation is yet to issue any statement concerning the same. Kariobangi Sharks are itching to find out their first opponent after reaching the continental level for the first time in their 12 years of existence. Gor, on the other hand, is gearing for a more fruitful campaign in the Champions League from which they were knocked out by Esperance of Tunisia in the first round. CAF decisions have often been leaked days or hours before the organisation sent out press statements and rumours about Saturday night’s draw abounded on social media with clubs that sent representatives to the Rabat meeting leaking bits and pieces of information. “Truth is OfficialGMFC reached the first round this year. #WeAreLobi return to #TotalCAFCL for the first time since 2000. No surprise, we have to start from preliminary,” Lobi Stars tweeted about their Champions League pairings while there was no mention of Confederation Cup pairings. Football website Eunicell appeared to have more information of the CAF Inter Clubs draw, suggesting Nigerian clubs Lobi Stars and Enugu Rangers have respectively been paired with Cameroons USM de Loum and Defence Forces of Ethiopia. The winner between Lobi and De Loum will then face Gor.
