The directors of the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA) risk punishment for allegedly meddling in the leadership and management of the 8,000-member Kiru Tea Factory in Murang’a county. The Court of Appeal will determine on February 22, next year whether a splinter group of the factory directors and the KTDA directors had orchestrated the removal of chairman Chege Kirundi and company secretary Bernard Kiragu on November 27, last year against express court orders. Impose fines Appellate judges William Ouko, Fatuma Sichale and James Otieno-Odek said yesterday the contempt proceedings, which were initiated by Kirundi and his allies who are facing rebellion from a rival camp supporting suspended director Stephen Githiga, will determine which group is lawfully in office following the protracted leadership crisis. Senior Counsel Paul Muite, assisted by lawyer Marete Githinji, asked the Bench to impose fines and jail-terms to each of the 14 directors for flouting an injunction issued by the court prohibiting them from holding an Annual General Meeting (AGM) on December 14 last year to approve the giant tea processor’s board changes. Impose fines However, lawyers Njoroge Regeru and Waweru Gatonye, representing the Githiga group claimed no elections were held to replace the aggrieved directors. Kirundi, Kiragu, vice chairman John Kariri and auditor Christopher Mwangi have accused their rivals of trying to paralyse the operations of the firm at the behest of powerful individuals who are seeking to control the tea industry in the region. The Githiga group has insisted on being the legitimate directors in control of the factory’s affairs.
