Over a million residents in Machakos county are set to benefit  from a free Universal Health Care plan following the launch of household registration drive in Kivaani Health Centre in Kangundo on Saturday. The programme will run in four selected counties of  Machakos, Nyeri, Isiolo and Kisumu for one year before it is scaled up across the country. Being one of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s legacy Big Four agenda, each of the counties will receive Sh800 million from the National government to run the programme and an additional over Sh800 million for referral cases. The initiative will cost the National government more than Sh3.7 billion Registration drive While launching the registration drive, Health Cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki (pictured left) urged County Governments to increase their investments to healthcare, saying  there was need to emphasise on prevention and diagnosis. “Free and quality healthcare for all Kenyans still remains dear to President Uhuru Kenyatta’s plan for citizens and we urge county governments to increase budgetary allocations to make it a success,” she said.
