Irene Githinji @gitshee The Kenya Obstetrical and Gynaecological Society (Kogs) has disowned controversial medical   practitioner Mugo wa Wairimu and maintains that he is not and has never been an obstetrician/gynaecologist. Responding to a local TV expose aired on Monday regarding Mugo  (pictured) and his rogue practice in Kayole,  Nairobi, Kogs said he has never been their member. Kogs president Dr Benjamin Odongo in a statement said Mugo’s practice bears the hallmarks of social injustice, lack of ethics and violation of human rights especially in the disrespect and inhumane treatment accorded to vulnerable women seeking care. Odongo said Mugo should face the law and severe recourse meted by the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board (KMPDB). He said the medical board’s core mission is protecting the public by setting requirements for registration to practise medicine, imposing practice conditions or restrictions and in extreme circumstances, revoking registration of practitioners. Urban centres “I have no doubt in my mind that patients, especially women, have died in this country as a result of the interventions of such quacks, who not only practice in rural areas but also in urban centres.  We should not allow patients to suffer at the hands of quacks,” he said. Odongo further said Mugo’s actions violate the Constitution, which says every individual should access universally the highest attainable standard of care including emergency treatment.  He termed Mugo’s practice an assault on the professional integrity of obstetricians and gynaecologists.
