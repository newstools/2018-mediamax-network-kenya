Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Members of the National Assembly will next week Wednesday take a vote on the Constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill 2018 that seeks to implement the two-thirds gender rule. National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi yesterday appealed to MPs to avail themselves to the House as the bill will require two thirds of the members to be presents for a vote to take place. Muturi told MPs to leave up to their pledges to the House to support the bill by ensuring that they will be present on the day of voting. For such a bill to proceed to third reading stage, it requires the support of two thirds of the members. “The house will be forced to put the question for second reading of the constitution amendment bill next week Wednesday at 2:30pm. Please be guided that members will be voting. There has been overwhelming support please show that support by showing up,” he said. National Assembly Leader of Majority Aden Duale cautioned members against absconding business adding that the vote will only happen if there will be 233 members present. “Two thirds of the members are required to be present and required to vote come Wednesday when we will subject the bill to vote” said Duale. On Wednesday, MPs concluded debate on the Bill which was on the second reading.
