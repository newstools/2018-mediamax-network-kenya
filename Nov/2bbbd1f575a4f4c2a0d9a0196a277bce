Irene Githinji @gitshee Amani National Congress (ANC) Party leader Musalia Mudavadi yesterday assured Nasa supporters that the opposition is intact, recent developments notwithstanding. Mudavadi said Opposition should not be misconstrued to mean certain individuals but rather an institution recognised by the Constitution. Despite the unity pact between President Uhuru Kenyatta and ODM leader Raila Odinga, Mudavadi said he is firmly in the opposition. He brushed off fears in some quarters that the country could revert to a one-party rule, saying the Constitution clearly states that Kenya is a multi-party system state. “I know Nasa supporters are worried but I am standing as a Nasa founder, telling them not to give up. Together with many others we are still in the opposition and people should abandon the perception that opposition means certain individuals or names,” he said in an interview with Milele FM. The former vice president said it is the role of the Opposition to provide alternative leadership and point out where things are going wrong. Criticism, he said, should not be confused with condemnation.  “Being in opposition does not mean you are not patriotic or that you are not loyal to the President,” he said. Mudavadi, however, said he had no problem with his Nasa co-principals Raila and Kalonzo Musyoka’s co-operation with the Jubilee administration and their recent diplomatic appointments.
