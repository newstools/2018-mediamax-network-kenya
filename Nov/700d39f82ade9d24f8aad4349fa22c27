IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati has dismissed  a petition  seeking his removal from office by 2017 Kakamega Senate aspirant Seth Panyako  terming it as  defective. The IEBC chairman  further accused the trade unionist of blackmail to avoid  paying litigation costs owed  to the commission. Panyako filed a petition in parliament  last week calling for Chebukati’s removal for engaging in illegality in last year’s Kakamega senatorial polls.
