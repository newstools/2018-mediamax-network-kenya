Irene Githinji @gitshee Opposition leader Raila Odinga yesterday called for the implementation of priority infrastructure projects while exploring new frontiers of connectivity in Africa. Raila, who is African Union’s (AU) Commission High Representative for Infrastructure Development, said realising Africa’s development agenda will require a fundamental change in behaviour and mindsets to make transformative decisions. Africa, he said, must overcome old habits of perpetual feasibility studies and procurement of consultancies saying the last thing the continent needs is a partnership with strings and conditions. He said the continent should avoid traditional and long gestation delivery mechanisms that bog down projects. “We are not inventing the wheel. We have tried and proven delivery mechanisms that we could implant with modifications to ensure speedy and smart delivery,” he said. Good governance He made the remarks during the opening of the 2018 Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa (PIDA) Week themed “Realising Africa’s Integration through Smart Infrastructure and Good Governance” in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe. Saying his task as an infrastructure envoy is to accelerate trans-boundary connectivity through infrastructure, Raila called for the need to push in the same direction. “It is doable if all of us push in the same direction. I count on fellow Africans, and friends of Africa, to join me to see the dreams of our founding fathers and aspirations of our children and grandchildren fulfilled for a better and inclusive Africa,” he said.
