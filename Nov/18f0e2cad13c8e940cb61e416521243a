Dickens Wasonga @PeopleDailyKe Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has so far interrogated more than 50 persons in the probe on the construction of the controversial Sh4.1 billion Lake Basin Development Authority (LBDA) mall in Kisumu. On Tuesday, the LBDA acting managing director Evans Atera received yet another letter from the commission inviting nine other individuals, who served at the authority’s board when the project was being implemented, for questioning. Those summoned to appear before EACC includes  Earlie Ngani, who served as the LBDA board as acting chair at one time and even appeared before the parliamentary budget committee in 2016 when LBDA was about to lose the mall to Cooperative Bank through auction over a Sh2.5 billion loan. Ngani, according to the letter addressed to the acting MD, is required to attend the sessions with EACC investigators on November 20. Katherine Muoki and Jack Otana are also expected at the commission’s Kisumu office on the same day in the afternoon while Stephen Mwanga, Patrick Ouya (who served on the board and is also the immediate former chief of staff at the Kisumu county government) and Nelson Kifworo are expected by the EACC team the following day. Former Mathare MP William Omondi, William Murunga and Abraham Koech will face the investigators on November 22. The acting MD is among those who have been questioned. “As the director, the probe team must be interested in talking to me. It is not that I am the one being investigated but as the person at the helm of the organisation that was implementing the mall project, it is obvious they must interview me,” he said recently in his office.
