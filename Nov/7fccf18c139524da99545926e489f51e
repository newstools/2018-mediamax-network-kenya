Josphat Kinyua @josphatkinyua Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) officers at the weekend raided the home of a Nyeri Member of County Assembly in Naromoru and recovered Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) equipment estimated to be worth one million shillings. The detectives from the DCI headquarters raided the premises after the metal rolls stolen from SGR yard in Nairobi several months ago were traced to the premises. Confirming the incident, Nyeri  county police commander Ali Nuno said the detectives raided the home of Naromoru Ward MCA Martin Matu and carted away the equipment said to be worth about one million shillings. The MCA was not, however, arrested but was ordered to present himself at the DCI headquarters tomorrow. But when he was contacted for comment, Matu denied that the equipment was found at his home.  He said he is not under any investigations and denied being summoned by the DCI. Matu also termed rumours of his arrest as mere propaganda. In 2007, President Uhuru Kenyatta issued a stern warning against vandalisation of SGR and said vandals would be sentenced to death.
