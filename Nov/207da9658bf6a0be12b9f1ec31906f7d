Dickens Wasonga @PeopleDailyKe Education Principal Secretary Belio Kipsang is blaming parents for the rising cases of indiscipline amongst students. Kipsang said parents have abdicated the role of moulding their children into responsible people. “The first people to blame are the parents of these children who have failed in moulding them,” Belio said. Speaking in Kisumu where he oversaw distribution of exam papers, the PS said indiscipline among students was a major  concern to government saying  the future of nation depends on its youth. “The government is investing a lot of money in the education sector and we cannot allow bad behavior to ruin the future of the country. Teachers should redeem their image so that they can be trusted to administer the exams without having to deploy security officers,” he said.
