Fred Aminga @faminga Tea farmers brought in some new faces in polls held to elect directors for the factories managed by Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA) Management Services Ltd. The sector, which has been facing headwinds, gave tea farmers, who are the factory shareholders, a chance to elect one-third of KTDA directors since they are supposed to retire on rotation every year. The KTDA-managed tea factory company directors elections are held every three years where a director who has been in office for that period seeks a fresh mandate from the electorate. During the elections held on November  6, Kiru Tea Factory chairman Stephen Maina Githiga retained the position against Wagana Maigua by garnering 23,023 shares against 6,274. Farmers also elected Francis Chege Kimari, a former chief executive of Stancom Tobacco Company in Thika, who beat Edward Ngumo. Samuel Kiige of Gatunguru Tea Factory emerged the victor to represent Kihoya electoral area by garnering 16,381 to his rival Charles Mwangi who garnered 13,361 votes. He takes over from the longtime director Samuel Muchunu who did not defend his seat.  All other directors from the Murang’a factories of Kanyenyaini, and Gatunguru were re-elected. In Kiamokama, shareholders sent two of their directors home while Nyamache and Ogembo re-elected their directors. Gianchore’s chairman Eucabeth Ogwaro was re-elected after garnering 19,369 votes against her rivals Thomas Ochaba’s 7,475 and John Moriasi’s 6,089 votes. Joseph Bogonko,, representing Ngenyi electoral area also retained his position of director. Kebirigo Tea Factory shareholders sent home director Job Ondari who garnered 7,924 votes against his challenger’s 9,427 votes. Charles Ongera comes in as a new director of the Factory.
