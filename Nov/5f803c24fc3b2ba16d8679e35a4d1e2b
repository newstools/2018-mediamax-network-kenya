Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe Eight Ambira Boys High School students captured on video hurling insults at Cabinet secretaries Amina Mohamed and Fred Matangi were arraigned yesterday. Appearing before Ukwala resident magistrate Gladys Adhiambo, the eight did not take the plea after the prosecutor requested for seven days to complete investigations into the matter. The teens will remain in police custody until December 3, when the case will be mentioned. “The suspects have indicated that they are all minors and me, therefore, order that they are held at the children’s cells,” said the magistrate. In a clip that has since gone viral, the eight, celebrating the completion of their KCSE exams, claimed to have cheated despite strict monitoring. They also hurled insults at the two CSs over efforts to wipe out in national exams malpractices. Reacting to the clip yesterday,  Kenya National Examinations Council chairman George Magoha regretted the moral decay in some of the students. Addressing journalists at Rang’ala Girls School, he also rubbished the students cheating claims, saying the exams were clean.
