For Emmanuel Njenga, a 14-year-old candidate from Stepping Stones Preparatory School in Makongeni in Thika, scoring 445 marks in the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam was unbelievable. Njenga who could not hide his joy after the announcement of the results said he wants to be a neurosurgeon. “I would like to go to Alliance Boys High School after which I would go to university to study medicine. I want to be a doctor to save lives. There is no secret to success, one only needs to be focused and disciplined,” he said. His father Michael Wathiomo said Njenga has defied many odds since his birth in 2004. Born prematurely and only weighing  1.8kg, he had to be given neonatal intensive care for two months. “He is a survivor and he has fought his way to where he is now. We thank God because it was not our doing but Hisdoing,” he said. School director Chris Irungu said the top performer was a hardworking and disciplined boy and praised teachers and parents for the good work.
