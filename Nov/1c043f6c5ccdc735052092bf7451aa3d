Thousands of commuters were today left stranded as the government made good its threat and began enforcing the stringent  Michuki rules  forcing most public service transport operators to pull their vehicles off the roads while several others were impounded during a countrywide crackdown. Several operators were arrested and their vehicles impounded leaving passengers stranded for hours even as the government vowed it will not relent in its crackdown on non-compliant operators. Dennis Matara reports on  a day that saw the matatu owners association call of its strike and vowed to co-operate with the government to ensure total compliance with the rules.
