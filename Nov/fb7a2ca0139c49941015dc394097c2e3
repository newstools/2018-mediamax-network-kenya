Farmers from Kiru tea factory in Murang’a will soon start getting higher returns after turning to orthodox tea. According to the factory chairman Stephen Githiga, fluctuating market prices for the commonly processed black tea has been hurting farmers who rely on the crop for their livelihood. Speaking during an annual general meeting, Githiga said they had secured a market for special teas in Russia, Asia and Europe. He said they have already obtained certification for export and the first sale shall be made during the first week of December. The factory, Githiga said, shall first process 10 per cent of the tea collected from farmers but shall increase the volume as the market for special teas expands. Orthodox teas, he said, fetch more money compared to normal black tea and this would be an added advantage for the farmers. “Orthodox tea fetches an extra dollar at the international market which means the farmers would get extra income” said Githiga. The chairman, however, said they shall be conducting massive sensitisation of farmers to enhance best farming practices to produce quality tea.
