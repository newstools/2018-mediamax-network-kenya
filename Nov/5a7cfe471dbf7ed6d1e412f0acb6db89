Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunhe Opposition leader Raila Odinga has welcomed the appointment of his Nasa co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka as head of the Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission on peace in South Sudan. Raila, who was last month appointed Africa Union’s High Representative for Infrastructure Development, also dismissed concerns that their co-operation with President Uhuru Kenyatta would kill the opposition. “The Handshake has created an atmosphere in which we can talk about issues soberly. The corrupt are finding it difficult to hide in their parties and tribes,” he said. Raila and Kalonzo are the leaders of ODM and Wiper respectively, two of the four parties that form the National Super Alliance (Nasa). The other Nasa parties are Amani National Congress led by Musalia Mudavadi and Ford Kenya of Bungoma Senator Moses Wetang’ula. The former Prime Minister described Kalonzo as competent enough to spearhead peace negotiations in South Sudan. Raila was speaking yesterday at his Capitol Hill office in Nairobi after hosting a delegation of Embu leaders headed by former Cabinet minister Joseph Nyagah. “We are happy to meet the former Prime Minister as a delegation from the Eastern region. We welcome him to Embu. We have discussed many issues including the Handshake and the Building Bridges Initiative which we support,” Nyagah said.
