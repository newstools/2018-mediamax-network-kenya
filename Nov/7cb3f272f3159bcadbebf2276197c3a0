A debate that has been raging for some time now with Marie Stopes Kenya Hospital, coming under the spotlight  over an advertisement that seems to suggest that the hospital was conducting abortions. The  petition filed by Ann Kioko of Citizengo.org to the Kenya Medical Practioners and Dentist Board (KMPDP) led to a decision by the board ordering the hospital to stop all abortions at its facilities and today in a statement to newsrooms, the hospital’s Director, Dana Tilson said: ‘We can confirm that Marie Stopes Kenya has suspended safe abortion services at the request of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board’ The hospital however continues to render other services for instance those pertaining reproductive health. The complaints by Citizengoafrica Campaigns manager Ann Kioko and Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB) CEO, Dr. Ezekiel Mutua claim the adverts some of which were online were promoting abortion.
