Mwangi Willy @PeopleDailyKe Technical and Vocation Education and Training (TVET) institutions are finalising preparations to roll out the new Competence-Based Education Training (Cbet) next year. The curriculum, which is aimed to address the mismatch between skills offered by institutions and competencies required by industry, is expected to start in January. Speaking at the Kitale National Polytechnic at the weekend, the Principal Secretary for Vocational and Technical Education and Training, Desai Kevit, said the training will be based on international standards. “The objective of our visit is to inspect facilities and their preparations towards the Competence Based Training,” he said. He called for collaboration between the national government and counties to ensure the success of the curriculum. Kevit said the government is looking for ways to provide institutions with sufficient training equipment and machinery. “We are investing in equipment to enable the learners to acquire necessary skills,” he noted. The government is creating space for showcasing innovations coming from the institutions and help commercialise their ideas,  the PS added.
