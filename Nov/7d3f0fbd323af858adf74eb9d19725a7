Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) yesterday suffered a major blow after the High Court ordered it to release former Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero seized property. In her ruling, Justice Hedwig Ong’undi barred the anti-graft agency from further searching and seizing Kidero’s property pending the hearing and determination of the main petition. “I order no further execution of search warrant or any other search warrant in respect to petitioner applicants. Any searched and seized properties which in respect to the petitioner must be released forthwith within the next 72 hours,” ruled Ong’undi. At the same time, the judge also expunged the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) from the proceedings, saying he has not played any role and has not been cited for any violation by the petitioners. “It will not serve any purpose to keep the DPP as a party in these proceedings. DPP doesn’t play any role and has not been cited for any violation,” she ruled. Ong’undi said the orders sought by Kidero require evidence to determine whether a search warrant should be relied on to optimise all the properties. Kidero had raised issues on whether EACC has jurisdiction to search aprivate property on matters relating to Mumias Sugar Company. Justice Ong’undi directed all necessary responses to be filed and served within the next 14 days. The case will be heard on December 4. Meanwhile, Anti-Corruption chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti yesterday also allowed release of Kidero’s passport to facilitate him to travel to Hong Kong from November 16 until December 14. “Kidero’s passport held by this court should be released to facilitate his travel to Hong Kong and the same should be deposited upon his return,” he said.
