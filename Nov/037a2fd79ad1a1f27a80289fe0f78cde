Fred Aminga @Faminga Stakeholders in the maritime transportation sector yesterday moved to shore up productivity with plans to launch a concept note on the multi-billion-shilling blue economy sector. They noted that without a properly planned shipping system Kenya will find it absolutely difficult to sustain development due to transportation handicaps and called for the country to put systems in order. “It is therefore important to address logistical challenges experienced at the port and along Kenya’s transport chain to make the country more competitive for business, “ they said. Regulatory framework Speaking on the sidelines of the blue economy conference, the stakeholders called for more supportive regulatory frameworks if the country intends to attain any progressive maritime transport wealth. “Kenya’s maritime regulatory framework needs to be aligned with international conventions and standards to create an enabling maritime environment,” said Loise Opiyo from Kisumu. The concept paper to be discussed today says that actions must be geared towards ensuring the blue economy resources will boost economic growth and address poverty. “If you look around you will see that most imports and exports take place through the sea,” said Benard Gitau, a proprietor of a local shipping line, adding that a number of regional countries depend on Kenya for their supplies. Kenya’s Port of Mombasa is a gateway to Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, northern Tanzania, DRC and Ethiopia.
