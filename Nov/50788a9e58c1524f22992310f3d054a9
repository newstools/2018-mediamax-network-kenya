Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Liaison Group has launched an insurance scheme that will allow its clients to get medical cover in their retirement. Dubbed Suluhu Umbrella Scheme, the plan is the first of its kind in Kenya and will allow members to port their medical cover through their pension and income drawdown in one platform. Under the scheme, a member can contribute both for retirement and a medical plan, and on attaining the retirement age, the funds for retirement will be utilised to secure a retirement benefit while the medical fund caters for their medical cover on retirement. Group managing director, Tom Mulwa, said the scheme comes against a backdrop of increased national healthcare burden, especially for retirees and the old, largely driven by the rise of lifestyle diseases. He said cost of medical health in Kenya stood at Sh73 billion in 2016 and was largely consumed by individuals who were in their sunset years. According to available statistics, in 2013, 34 per cent of individuals with over 65 years were admitted to hospitals, compared to 25 per cent in 1998. “Suluhu Umbrella Scheme will not just guarantee one a stable income in retirement but will also cater for medical cover,” Mulwa said. He said the group has established a competent staff that would ensure high quality service to clients. Nzomo Mutuku, Retirement Benefits Authority  chief executive officer said as a regulator they are committed in their resolve to ensure a supportive environment for such innovative products exists in the country.
