Wounded Kisii RFC and high-flying Kisumu lock horns in a KRU Championships tie at Gusii Stadium tomorrow in what will be a meeting of teams with promotion ambitions. Kisii, relegated from the Kenya Cup last season, and Kisumu, who were demoted two years ago, have made promotion their target this season and tomorrow’s clash will give each of them an idea of how well they are prepared for the fight. Already, Kisii have been given a wakeup call following last weekend’s 17-10 loss to Western Bulls and another defeat will further dent their chances given they sit sixth on the table with five points. Kisumu have had a perfect start to the season, winning their opening two matches to sit top of the log with nine points and they are considered favourites in tomorrow’s match although assistant coach Daniel Orongo is remaining cautious. “It’s too early in the season to make any predictions. We take every game at a time and maybe that strategy will take us all the way. We respect our opponents a lot but we will take the game to them,” said Orongo. The other interesting match will see second-placed United States International University-Africa (USIU-Africa) Martials meet Mombasa RFC, who were also relegated from the Kenya Cup last season. Mombasa will be hoping to get it right after succumbing to a 39-9 defeat to Catholic Monks last weekend to drop to ninth place with four points while USIU-Africa are out to continue their impressive start to the season. Catholic Monks, third on the log with nine points, eye a third straight victory at home to fifth-placed Ngong Warriors while fourth-placed Western Bulls welcome Kitale RFC.
