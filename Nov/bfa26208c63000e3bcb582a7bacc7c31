An 86-year-old man has appealed to President Uhuru Kenyatta to help him get back his land title deed which has been held by a bank for more than 40 years. Kamau Mai told People Daily he had borrowed Sh3,000 from Cooperative Bank, Githunguri branch in 1977 using the title deed of his four-acre piece of land as collateral. Speaking at his Bibirioni village home in Limuru, Mai said they agreed with the bank that it would be deducting Sh150 per month from his account. But after a year, he said, a stranger visited his home and claimed he had bought the land in an auction because he had failed to service the loan. Mai claims that, at the time, the bank had already deducted Sh2,200 from his account and issued him with all the transaction receipts. He said that when he demanded his title deed back, the bank gave him an unsatisfactory response. Mai sued the bank but the cases at a Kiambu court and the High Court in Nairobi have never been heard.  His wife Philomena Wangare, 79, said their attempts to get help from Anti Banking Fraud Unit have not been successful.
