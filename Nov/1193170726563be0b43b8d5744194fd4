A 42-year-old man from Misanga in Bukembe West Ward of Bungoma County’s passion for football conquers distance making him yearn to cycle to Rwanda in support for Bungoma County staff football team. Kennedy Makokha, first hit the headlines when he cycled to Lodwar to cheer Bukembe High School football team which he did successfully to the dismay of many. Bungoma County staff football team garnered second position in the Kenya Inter County Sports and Cultural Association (KICOSCA) games that took place in August this year in Kisii County and is set to proceed to Rwanda in due time to participate in the East African Local Authority Sports and Cultural Association (EALASCA) games. Makokha, a father of four, one girl and three boys is a farmer whose passion in football goes way back to primary and secondary schools where he played football. However, his dream of being a professionally footballer was cut short when he did not succeed to enrol in Nzoia Sugar Company football team and he resorted to being a football fan. “I did not just become a football fanatic out of the blues; I used to play football with celebrities like the late Ken Simiyu, Mark Sirengo and Salim Babu at KCC with Rashid Shed as the coach,” recalled Makokha. When asked whether the drive to cycle that distance is a means towards earning an income, Makokha denied the assumption and said all he gains is the fun of supporting his favourite teams despite the location of the sport. “I derive joy in supporting our local teams because all they need is to be cheered by their own people and they will emerge victorious,” said Makokha. Speaking to Makokha at the County Department of Gender, Culture, Youth and Sports offices, director Alice Wafula acknowledged his sacrifice and determination towards supporting the local teams and pledged county government support.
