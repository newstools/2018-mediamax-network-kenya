ALVIN MWANGI Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed has asked public universities not to admit more students if they are financially incapable of accommodating them. The directive comes after complaints of low funding by most public universities while the enrollment rate keeps rising yearly. For the last five years, university enrollment has witnessed rapid growth because of the increase of qualified applicants, programmes and faculties. Speaking after meeting the Parliamentary Budget and Appropriations Committee and vice-chancellors of public universities on Friday, Amina urged the institutions to find ways to resource and facilitate the provision of quality, relevant and competitive education. “Because of this expansion, we must find ways to resource and facilitate the provision of quality, relevant and competitive education by public facilities,” she said. Currently, the government spends about 27 per cent of its budget on education with Sh103 billion going to university education and Sh200 billion to basic education. At the same time, Amina urged universities to align courses and programmes to meet market demands. She expressed fears that most recent graduates cannot meet the market demands. “Re-align yourself with programmes that are market viable,” she added.
