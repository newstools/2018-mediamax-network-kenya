Manchester, Tuesday @PeopleSports Alexis Sanchez is closer than ever to an early exit from Manchester United following his latest snub by Jose Mourinho. The Chilean was dropped from the squad entirely for United’s Tuesday night Champions League victory over Young Boys. Sanchez only joined United in January, as part of a swap deal with Arsenal for Henrikh Mkhitaryan, but does not feel he has not future at the club under Mourinho. Sanchez is said to be keen on a move to Paris Saint-Germain, who are one of the only clubs able to afford anywhere close to his bumper deal at Old Trafford. The forward, who is paid £450,000 plus bonuses, is easily the highest paid player at the club. After the 1-0 victory on Tuesday, Mourinho confirmed that Sanchez was not injured, effectively confirming publicly that the player had been dropped. He said: ‘No, Sanchez is not injured. But is quite curious you always speak about the ones that are not playing.’ The 29-year-old Chilean was unveiled to great fanfare last January after the swap with Mkhitaryan was confirmed, but he has failed to live up to expectation. He has scored just four times in 30 appearances for the Red Devils, with just one goal in the 2018-19 season.                                                  -AFP
