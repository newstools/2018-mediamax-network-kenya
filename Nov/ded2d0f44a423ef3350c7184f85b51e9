Lanet area in Nakuru County has been selected as the suitable site for construction of an airport with work expected to start next year. Governor Lee Kinyanjui said his government was working closely with Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) to ensure success of the capital project. He said the airport will help in the transportation of perishable farm produce, including flowers. He said the airport, and the planned industrial park in Naivasha will serve as some of the incentives that will attract investors in the area. Speaking during the Nakuru International Investment Conference (NIICO) at Naivasha, Kinyanjui expressed concern over the huge chunks of unused land in the county. He said his government will engage land owners to ensure that vast land is leased for farming noting that there was a ready market for avocado, pyrethrum and dairy products in China for the county to exploit. He promised to work with private partners to increase employment opportunities and wealth for the county residents saying Nakuru County was third after Nairobi and Kiambu in terms of GDP. Addressing the investors, the governor said his government was working closely with KenGen and GDC companies to produce cheap power to companies that will be located in the proposed Industrial Park. Kinyanjui added that the extended SGR to Naivasha was a big plus for the investors in the county with the new US flights opening up a new market for flowers produced in Naivasha. The PS for Investment and Industry, Beth Maina, praised the planned industrial park noting that such facilities constructed outside Nairobi would get 100 per cent VAT exception in their machinery and production goods. She said the government was keen on reviving the cotton sector and has pumped in sh4 billion to Rivatex plant in Eldoret to help increase sale of textile to the US market.
