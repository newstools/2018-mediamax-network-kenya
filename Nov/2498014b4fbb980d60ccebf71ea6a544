National Women Football team Harambee Starlets gave away an early lead to draw 1-1 with Ghana’s Black Queens in a build-up encounter as the two sides prepare for next weekend’s Africa Women Cup of Nations. Starlets drew first blood in the 14th minute through a Mercy Achieng tap in after she had positioned herself well, getting at the end of  Mwanahalima Adam’s cross. Starlets looked the weaker side in the opening minutes of the match as Queens dominated play keeping the ball on Starlets half for the first 10 minutes. However, coach Ouma’s charges shook off the shaky start for the goal that seemed to snap them to action. Portia Boaleye had a chance to give Queens the equaliser in the 19th minute when she was played on by Elizabeth Addo beating the offside trap. But with just starting goalkeeper Annette Kundu to beat,  she sent her shot straight to the keeper’s hands. Starlets continued their onslaught but were not clinical in their finishing. They were almost punished in the 29th minute as Addo’s cross was headed by Boaleye but missed the goal by few inches. Ouma’s charges headed to the break with the slight advantage but a revamped Ghana returned ready for war as they pitched a tent on Starlets’ half. Ouma introduced Neddy Atieno in the 65th minute for goalscorer Achieng injecting some speed in the left wing. Three more changes followed for both sides which bore the equaliser for Queens in the 77th minute through new blood Grace Asamilewaa. Ghana was again denied by the goal post in stoppage time. Starlets host Mali on Saturday in another AWCON build-up match ahead of their scheduled November 14 travel dates.
