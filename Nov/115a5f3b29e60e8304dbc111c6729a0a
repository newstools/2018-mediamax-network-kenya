Joseph Irungu alias Jowie, the prime suspect in the killing of Monica Kimani, yesterday filed an application in the High Court seeking to have judge James Wakiaga recuse himself from his case. In the application filed by his lawyers Cliff Ombeta, Sam Nyaberi and Laichena Mugambi, Jowie argues he is apprehensive Justice Wakiaga will not give him a fair trial. Denied bail He says the judge showed open bias and even maligned his name during the ruling on bail application that saw his fiancee and co-accused Jacque Maribe freed Sh2 million cash bail on October 30. Jowie was denied bail. In the ruling, Justice Wakiaga described  Jowie as “a male version of a slay queen. Which for lack of better terminology, I will call a woman-eater.” Jowie terms the description “uncouth, derogatory and injudicious” language, adding that the judge exhibited lack of impartiality and independence required of a judicial officer a. “I am convinced the judge in denying me bail addressed my application not on the merits of facts and evidence but on account of external influence and consideration of false and misleading information,” reads the application in part. Jowie argues that Justice Wakiaga has already adjudged him and  painted him as a criminal against the principle of presumption of innocence until proven guilty.
