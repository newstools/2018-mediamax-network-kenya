Former Machakos Senator, Johnstone Muthama, has defended the March 9th handshake between President Uhuru Kenyatta and NASA co-principal Raila Odinga, saying that it was for the good of this country especially after the 2017 general election that nearly divide the country once again. Muthama says the NASA coalition is still intact and that they are putting their house in order as opposition and they should not be politically mistaken that the opposition has been swallowed by Jubilee. However, he has renewed his call on Wiper party leader, Kalonzo Musyoka, to come out clearly and explain to his supporters and Kenyans at large on now the infamous ” mtu wa mkono” phrase that continuos to elicit mixed reactions across the political divide.
