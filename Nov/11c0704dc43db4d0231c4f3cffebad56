Western Stima has made 10 signings as they prepare for a return to the top flight in December. Managers of the Kisumu County-based outfit are overly cautious in the transfer market after attributing their demotion to internal sabotage by a section of players and officials who did not approve of the team’s relocation from Kakamega to Kisumu. “We paid dearly for what happened within the club by going down to the National Super League but we learnt a very big lesson. We will always be on the lookout for any sign of such happenings and sort out before we are consumed again,” club chairman Laban Jobita said. Top on the list of recruited players is Baron Oketch, a once prolific scorer for Stima who decamped to Gor Mahia midway through the 2016 season. Oketch failed to replicate his scoring form at K’Ogalo and was promptly loaned to Bandari and Ulinzi Stars where he slumped further into oblivion. “In this career, there are always ups and downs and I’m back at Stima to redeem myself and vie for the golden boot,” said Oketch. Stima have also redrafted Kennedy Agogo who will rival Oketch for a starting role in the team’s attack. Experienced defender Vincent Omumbo who once captained National U23 team while turning out for Thika United has also joined Stima as well as former Tusker FC captain and utility man Luke Ochieng, full-back Samuel Olare, midfielder Vincent Odongo and Clifford Omondi. Striker Henry Eshikobo and Ian Otieno are already training with the club but yet to pen deals while budding goalkeeper Anthony Obonyo has been offered a two-year contract.
