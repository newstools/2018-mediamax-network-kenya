Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has come under sharp criticism over his remarks during his late father’s burial last Friday where he pledged to work closely with President Uhuru Kenyatta  saying he was ready to be his errand boy. Former Machakos county Senator Johnstone Muthama and Makueni county Governor Prof. Kivutha Kibwana claim the statement has sparked disquiet in the region and is likely to taint the Wiper leader’s 2022 presidential bid.
