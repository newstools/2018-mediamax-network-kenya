Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Echesa has waded into the turf wars within Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) pitting outgoing chairman John Kameta and secretary general Isaac Mbote. Both Kameta (pictured) and Mbote—who are fighting for the control of BAK affairs—organised two parallel fourth leg league events at the weekend one in Kakamega and the other in Mwingi, creating confusion. But with each camp insisting their event was legitimate, Echesa seems to have endorsed the Mbote camp as he attended the Kakamega event, drawing the wrath of Kameta. “Why is the CS following suspended people. Mbote and his camp are all suspended officials yet the CS who is supposed to be neutral seems to be endorsing them. Echesa is presiding over an illegality because he is following people who were banned several months ago,” said a furious Kameta in Mwingi. He added: “His behaviour is going to get us banned by AIBA (International Boxing Association) and if that happens, then the future of these young boxers is messed.” But speaking in Kakamega, Echesa dismissed the Kameta camp, saying they are using the AIBA card to stay in office illegally. “I want to tell those who wrote a letter to AIBA that they will not succeed because Kenya has laws and we will not be intimidated. Those making noise are responsible for this mess and I have instructed the Sports Registrar to conduct an audit and if it is revealed that money was stolen, then those responsible will face the law,” said Echesa. “After the audit, we will make sure that there is credible elections which will see the right people running BAK so that we improve boxing in the country. We also want to ensure that we tap talent from all over the country and not just in Nairobi,” he added. There has been deep mistrust between both camps since the Sports Disputes Tribunal ordered BAK to immediately convene a Special General Meeting in order to plan for the elections that must be held within 60 days from November 6.
