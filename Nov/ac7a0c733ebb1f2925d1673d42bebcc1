Sony Sugar have released nine players as they intensify their preparations for the 2018/19 SportPesa Premier League (SPL) season that begins on December 8. The nine are Salim Sowedi, Bernard Omondi, Castro Mumbara, Collins Neto, Fredrick Onyango, Kevin Oluoch, Joseph Omweri, Robert Ouma and Clinton Omondi. Sony confirmed that Neto, who joined the club in the middle of last season from Chemelil Sugar FC, has had his contract terminated by mutual consent and it is believed the striker is close to being snapped up by National Super League (NSL) side Wazito FC. Veteran Oluoch retired at the end of last season after 14 years in the top flight, a stint that saw him clinch three league crowns with Sony (2006) Sofapaka (2009) and Gor Mahia (2015). Elsewhere, Zoo FC has completed the signing of former Palos FC and Ushuru midfielder Allan Odhiambo on a two-year deal. Zoo are rebuilding after losing a number of key players to rival teams at  the end of the 2018 campaign. High-scoring midfielder Mike Madoya decamped to Tusker FC while forwards Nicholas Kipkirui and Dominic Kiprono joined Gor and Chemelil Sugar FC respectively. Defender Isaac Kipyegon also moved to Leopards. Zoo chairman Ken Ochieng has confirmed Odhiambo’s signing while exuding confidence that the holding midfielder will strengthen his side. He also disclosed that the club will beef up its attack and goalkeeping departments before the start of the new season.
