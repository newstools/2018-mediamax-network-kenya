Parliament risks losing millions of shillings if it suspends the health insurance scheme being provided to MPs. Sources within Parliament yesterday said terminating the current contract, reportedly undertaken by Jubilee Insurance in a two-year contract, will cost taxpayers because some MPs  and staff members have already exhausted their covers, while others are on active treatment. The source said some MPs, especially the polygamous, are frustrated by the current company’s failure to include more than one spouse in the health scheme. The matter arose at a Speaker’s informal meeting (Kamukunji) last week. MPs have also complained that the current insurance scheme is ineffective as most legislators end up paying for their medical bills whenever they seek treatment.
