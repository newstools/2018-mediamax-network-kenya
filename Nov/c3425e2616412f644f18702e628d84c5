Roy Lumbe @lumbe_roy Shock and grief has gripped Piave area in Njoro, Nakuru county, after a police officer shot his wife dead before taking his life on Monday. Cornelius Taalam, 28, attached to Piave Police Base reportedly had an argument with his wife Eunice Wambui, 22, before shooting her and himself afterwards. The couple was reportedly married for only three months. Wambui’s uncle Stephen Maina told People Daily  she completed secondary school last year and relocated to Piave in search of a job before meeting Taalam. “Wambui was a happy soul, she used to visit me when her husband was at Neissiut on patrol during the skirmishes and she seemed happy,” he said. Area police commandant Hassan Barua said police have launched investigations into the incident, adding that police at the base keep guns for patrol purposes. He said the police base has lost two officers in a week.  The other reportedly succumbed to kidney failure  after excessive consumption of second-generation liquor.
