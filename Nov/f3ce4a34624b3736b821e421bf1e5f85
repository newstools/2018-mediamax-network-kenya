National women’s football team Harambee Starlets take on Ghana’s Black Queens this afternoon in the first of two high-profile friendlies lined up for them ahead of Africa Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) that starts next weekend. Coach David Ouma says that the match will largely form the basis of his final squad of 21 that will travel to Ghana for Starlets’ second appearance at the continental showpiece that doubles up as a 2019 Women’s World Cup qualifier. “The squad has been in training for a week and we have concentrated on fitness and slightly touched on the tactical aspect of the match. The previous friendly matches against Women’s Premier League select and Under 15 boys helped me trim the team to 25 after gauging the fitness levels of my players,” said Ouma ahead of the 4pm kick off. He added: “I will use as many players today as is possible as we now get to test our different strategies, tactics and approach to the game. I will also be looking to have a working combination in all fronts depending on the flow, rhythm and intensity of attack when paring certain players.” “The statistics of a player in training can be good but the international stage is a different ball game. I have to travel with the best tactically, physically and mentally,” he said. Those dropped include National Under 23 goalkeeper Diana Tembesi, defender Phelistus Kadari from Vihiga Queens, Jentrix Shikangwa of Wiyeta Girls and Martha Amunyolete of Trans Nzoia Falcons. Ghana is ranked 47th in the world and second in Africa behind South Africa who are 38th globally. Kenya ranks 129th globally, having dipped six places in September.
