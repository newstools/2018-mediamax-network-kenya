Machakos Governor Dr. Alfred Mutua has been cleared by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Noordin Haji in a case connected with the purchase of subaru vehicles in 2013 for the county government. In a consent entered at the court of appeal before justice Roselyne Nambuye, Justice Milton Makhandia and Justice Prof. Otieno Odek, DPP Haji effectively stopped any move to investigate and prosecute Governor Mutua over the matter. Dr.Mutua lauded the DPP’s  move saying the case was a burden to him.
