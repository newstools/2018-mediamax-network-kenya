Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Parliamentary Powers and Privileges Committee wants the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) to investigate claims that some MPs were bribed with between Sh10,000 and Sh20,000 to reject a report on the importation of alleged illegal and contaminated sugar. “The DCI and the EACC to investigate the bribery allegations against some MPs during the consideration of the Report of the Joint Committee of the Departmental Committee on Trade and the Departmental Committee on Agriculture, on the importation of alleged illegal and contaminated sugar into the country within 90 days of adoption of this report,” the report read in part. In the report tabled in the House, the privileges committee chaired by National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi admitted that some MPs could have been bribed to reject the report that had indicted Cabinet Secretaries Adan Mohammed, who was in the trade docket, and Henry Rotich (National Treasury). The committee said its decision came after thorough review  of newspaper articles and video clips attributed to various MPs, who appeared before the committee as witnesses; oral evidence adduced by witnesses and a review and examination of the footage of the National Assembly. The privileges committee, however, regretted that no witnesses tabled evidence of having seen any MP receiving bribes from Wajir Woman Rep Fatuma Gedi to reject the sugar report.
