Three counties have been indicted by the Auditor General Edward Ouko over mismanagement of funds amounting to billions of shillings for the year ending June 2017. In a report tabled in the Senate last week Thursday, Ouko raised queries over  Kisumu, Siaya and Homa Bay counties expenditure. According to Ouko the queries relate to unsupported expenditure on domestic and air travel,  imprests, upgrading and construction of various offices, purchase of drugs, unaccounted for money meant for maternity as well as irregular transfer of money to various departments. Ouko raised queries over differences in Homa Bay budget of Sh20.4 million and Sh935.2 million meant for development and recurrent budget respectively that could not be accounted for. On imprests, Ouko regretted that Sh4.1 million were processed outside the Integrated Financial Management Information System (Ifmis) while Sh7.4 million meant for maternity health care is yet to be disbursed. Procure Internet Ouko raised concerns that at least 27 officers in Siaya are holding Sh62 million worth of imprests with each holding more than the required Sh500,000. He also raised queries over how the county procured the provision of Wide Area Network (WAN) connectivity and internet bandwidth at a contract sum of Sh108 million payable in six installments of Sh18 million annually yet there are other similar infrastructures in the county offered by other telecommunication service providers like Safaricom and Telkom.
