Former Finance minister Musalia Mudavadi has called for formation of an independent public debt management commission to check on government’s external borrowing appetite. He said the commission, with similar powers to those of an Auditor General, should be tasked with monitoring, evaluating and making recommendations to the National Treasury on financial decisions especially when borrowing for development projects. He challenged accountants and lawyers to lobby for the commission that will counter check financial commitment initiated by the government to avoid excessive borrowing. “We need to have an independent institution that will keep watch on the movements of the government on monetary matters, the reality is the public debt is now threatening economic growth,”said the Amani Nation Congress party leader while addressing the premier Institute of Certified Public Accountants of Kenya (Icpak) public finance and tax conference in Mombasa yesterday. Mudavadi said Parliament had failed to interrogate reports by the Auditor General which expose massive wastage of public resources. “The issue of ballooning public debt is a serious one and citizens have been held hostage by parliament because they have failed to play their oversight role,” said Mudavadi.
