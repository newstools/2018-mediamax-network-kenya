Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board (KMPDB) has exonerated MP Shah Hospital from any wrongdoing after it billed the late Matilda Anyango Sh800, 000 for services rendered in less than 24 hours. KMPDB cleared the hospital on grounds that it followed the Professional Fee Guidelines for Medical and Dental Practitioners Revised Edition, 2016. Appearing before the National Assembly’s Health Committee chaired by Murang’a Woman’s Representative Sabina Chege, a team that investigated the matter, led by Dr Nyaim Opot, said the fees were justified. The committee said Sh402, 750 was payment for professional services offered by the vascular surgeon and the anaesthesiologists while the rest, Sh485,955, was a fee payable for nursing care, pharmacy, laboratory, equipment, bed, and other hospital charges. “The committee, having considered the totality of this matter finds that the deceased received appropriate care at the hospital and the fee charged for the professional services by the vascular surgeon and the anesthesiologist are within the prescribed guidelines,” read the report. However, KMPDB chief executive Daniel Yumbia told the MPs that the board had started reviewing the prices charged by private hospitals. “We have already started the review and we are committed to giving a report to the Health ministry within three months,” he said. Ndhiwa MP Martin Owino had questioned where the board benchmarked before coming up with the “unreasonable” hospital fees, adding that more than 90 per cent of Kenyans cannot afford the cost of healthcare. James Murgor (Keiyo North) told KMPDB to ensure that the fee guidelines are reviewed to conform to the Kenyan realities, especially those of rural areas.
