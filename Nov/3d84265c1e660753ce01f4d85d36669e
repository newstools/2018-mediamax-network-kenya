Migori Governor Zachary Okoth Obado now says, the three guns found at his body guards quarters in his compound and were not licensed are not his. In his affidavit Obado insinuates that one of the guns was planted by an EACC officer. Obado will however   spend another day in police cells  pending a ruling Friday which will determine his  bail/bond status.
