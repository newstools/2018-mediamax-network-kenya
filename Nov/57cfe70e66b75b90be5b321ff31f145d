The Powers and Privileges Committee, has this morning reprimanded Embakasi East Member of Parliament Babu Owino and his Starehe counterpart Charles Njagua, after they were involved in a scuffle in the precincts of parliament in 2017. The committee chair, National Assembly Speaker, Justin Muturi, said the MPs’ behaviour had invited parliament to ridicule and lowered its dignity.
The two have however apologized on the floor of the house and have been allowed to continue with their duties.
