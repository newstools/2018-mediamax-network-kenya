National Youth Service case has been adjourned until Friday. Chief Magistrate Douglas Ogoti  is expected to make a ruling on a demand by the  defence team  that the  prosecution side should not bring in new evidence  to the case . Ogoti made the ruling after lawyer Wandugi Kirathe  requested to be given time to go through through new evidence presented by the prosecution on Tuesday, since he could not attend court proceedings yesterday as he had another matter at the court of appeal.
