Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi An Eldoret Court has issued a warrant of arrest against a son of prominent North Rift politician-cum-farmer Jackson Kibor over failure to appear in court in a case in which his father has sued him over trespass. Chief Magistrate Charles Obulutsa ordered the immediate arrest of Ezekiel Kibor, who is among three sons of the veteran politician. Others are Evans and Raymond that he has sued for cultivating on part of his 2,000-acre land in Kebenes area, Uasin Gishu county. Ezekiel is the third born son from the veteran politician’s third wife Naomi Cheptoo, whom he has also filed for divorce at an Eldoret law court. The magistrate asked Officer Commanding Eldoret Station (OCS )  to effect the arrest warrant against Ezekiel for failing to appear in court as summoned over the matter. During the hearing of the case on Tuesday, Kibor, 84, narrated how his sons, who were armed with machetes and clubs invaded his vast land aboard a pickup vehicle on  December 27 last year. He said they then threatened his workers with death should they attempt to block them from carrying out their mission on the farm prompting the employees to alert him about the incident. “I am still the owner of the vast farm in Kebenes area and at no time have I allocated part of it to my sons as they claim in their police statements.  It’s unfortunate that my sons have been cultivating the land and leasing part of it to neighbours without my consent,” he told the court. In their defence, the children told the court that their father was lying to the court regarding the share of the disputed land. Led by Evans and Raymond, they said their father sub-divided the 1,250-acre farm among his sons and even obtained title deeds in their names. The case will be heard on February 7.
