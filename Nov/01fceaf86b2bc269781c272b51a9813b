Kenya Prisons women’s team are burning the midnight oil in search of a winning formula to reclaim the Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) league trophy they last won in 2013. Captain Evelyne Makuto says their motivation is not only to end the five-year drought but also use the title triumph to encourage the young players in the squad who are just starting their career. “The experienced players won’t stay forever and we have to set the stage for the young players. Winning the title will help these promising players secure employment too. We are aware of the herculean task this will be since all the other teams will be out to challenge for the title so we will not underrate anyone,” said Makuto She added: “This is our time and as the captain, there is nothing I would love more than to win the title. We have come so close yet too far in previous editions and we are working on our mistakes with the title in mind.” Their male counterparts have also been challenged to win this year’s crown as it will also hand them a ticket to next year’s Africa Club Championship in Cairo, Egypt. Both teams finished runners-up last year with men’s side falling to champions General Service Unit while the wardresses lost to nemesis Pipeline. The wardresses start their title campaign on December 1 with a tie against hard-fighting Kenya Commercial Bank before facing new comers Bungoma County. They will wrap up the three-day event with a tie against champions Pipeline on December 2. The warders will play Kenya Defence Forces (KDF), Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) and holders GSU in that order.
