English Premier League (EPL) legend Robbie Fowler on Friday visited the Camp Toyoyo Grounds in Nairobi’s Jericho suburb for a football clinic that brought together youngsters under the Musa Otieno Foundation. Fowler, who is on a three-day Kenya visit courtesy of Barclays Kenya- a member of Absa Group Limited, used the occasion to impart some of his experience on the youth present. The legend, who is best remembered for his time at Liverpool and as the sixth-highest goal scorer in the history of the Premier League, is in the country for several activities aimed at engaging EPL fans in Kenya. “As an ex-player of the English Premier League, I am so excited to be visiting the country, I have never been here before, so I am really looking forward to that. I know the passion for the premier league is magnificent and I am particularly looking forward to interacting with some of the young, talented footballers here and hopefully passing on some tips and advice that can help them on their journey.” Fowler said on his arrival. In his retirement, through the Robbie Fowler Education and Football Academy, the England legend has been helping Liverpool youths realise their football dreams. Established in 2015, Fowler’s academy combines applied learning with player development and placement and has so far sent 30 students into university with over 10 going into professional or semi-professional football and a further six winning football scholarships into American universities. “There’s a lot of talent here and we are committed to offering the best coaching and football experience for our students,” Fowler said during the session. “When I look at all of you, I see all the great football names of the future…Henry Wanyama, Macdonald Mariga, Divock Origi and many others…you know all these things are possible.”
