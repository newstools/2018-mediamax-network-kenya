I love me some cocktail on a sunny Saturday, especially when accompanying a tasty brunch.  I was recently invited to brunch with Singleton at The brew Bistro in Westlands. The brunch takes place every last Saturday of the month from 11.00 am to 5.00pm. The menu features meals inspired by the three Singleton variants; The Singleton of Dufftown, The Singleton Tailfire and The Singleton Sunray. Here are my two cents. THE SINGLETON DOUBLE-C COCKTAIL Rate 7 The Singleton Double-C Cocktail has sunray single malt scotch paired with coffee and coconut water. It’s the best choice for coffee lovers, although I have to mention I’m not a big fan of coffee myself. Imagine the taste of alcohol, but with coffee, or coffee spiked with alcohol. To each their own I guess. Singleton of Dufftown-Old fashion. Rate 9 If you are a lover of classic cocktails then you will love this glass of old-fashioned. Apart from Singleton, it has a mix of stirred scotch with Angostura bitters, orange peel, and sugar syrup. It can be described as a mighty fine drink. It’s strong, square-jawed, with just enough balance to keep you from getting too tipsy. THE SINGLETON TAILFIRE – BERRY JAM OLD SOUR Rate 10 This was my favourite of the three. Anytime I see a cocktail mix with egg white I know it’s going to blow me away, even before taking a sip.  I loved the froth and trust me on this, you really don’t taste the egg white. The combination with the berry jam gives you a lasting savoury finish. It also balances the two dashes of Angostura Bitters.
