Deputy President William Ruto’s allies  yesterday met former Bomet governor Isaac Ruto (pictured) in a move seen by observers as meant to  consolidate his support base. The meeting which brought together Chama Cha Mashinani party officials, elected leaders, former aspirants and supporters was held at Ruto’s Bomet home. Yesterday’s day-long meeting was attended by governors Paul Chepkwony (Kericho), Samuel Tunai (Narok) and Jackson Mandago (Uasin Gishu) and John Lonyangapuo (West Pokot, Kanu). Others were Kericho senator Aaron Cheruiyot, Ruto’s personal assistant Farouk Kibet and Chepalungu MP Gideon Koskei. The two Rutos were in opposing camps in the last election with the then Bomet governor backing the Nasa coalition of Raila Odinga. He lost his governor’s seat to Jubilee’s Joyce Laboso, an ally of the DP. After the meeting, the leaders declined to speak to the press. A source who attended the meeting said the 2022 election, in which DP Ruto intends to succeed President Uhuru Kenyatta, was the main agenda. But the former governor denied that the meeting was about the next election. “People have been meeting and there is nothing wrong when as leaders from Rift Valley also meet as to iron out issues affecting us and our people,” he told the press after the meeting.
