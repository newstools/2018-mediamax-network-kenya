Mukalo Kwayera @kwayeram The Public Service Commission (PSC) will next week conduct interviews for the anti-graft agency chief executive following Halakhe Waqo’s retirement. Among the 14 candidates shortlisted for the November 27-29 interviews include former  Kenya Defence Forces Spokesman Col Cyrus Oguna, current Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC)  deputy CEO Micheal Mubea, former National Police Service Commissioner Mohamed Murshid and Public Prosecutions assistant director James Warui. Others are Reuben Chirchir, who in 2016 served as one of the Joint Secretaries to the tribunal that probed Supreme Court justice Philip Tunoi, former Independent Police Oversight Authority chief executive Joel Mabonga, Humphrey Nakitari, Twalib Mbarak, Abdi Mohamud, Lucy Wanja Kinuthia, Chege Thenya Muchiri, Sarah Kilemi, Jillo Kasse and Vincent Omari Okongo. A graduate of the National Defence College of Kenya, Oguna currently works in the KDF Training and Doctrine section, at Defence headquarters. He holds a master’s degree in Peace and Conflict Resolution Studies from the University of Nairobi and is also pursuing another master’s degree in International Studies, also from the University of Nairobi. He has previously served as the Defence Attachee at the Kenyan Embassy in Tanzania. Mubea, a long-serving deputy to Waqo, is seen as a shrewd and vastly-experienced operative with a deeper understanding of the inner workings of the State agency, an ingredient that could work in favour of his candidacy whereas Warui’s legal background and long stint at the State Law Office areas seen top-ups to his credential in seeking the top seat at the anti-graft agency.
