Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has called on the Building Bridges unity advisory taskforce to ensure its final report reflects views of Kenyans as expressed in the grassroots. Speaking during a public participation forum with the team at the Kitui Multi-Purpose Hall on Tuesday, Ngilu said for the country to achieve unity, public views should be considered with an open mind. She also said there is a need for an amendment to increase the counties’ overall share of the national revenue from 15 per cent and have an equitable share as per the county’s population and size. The task force, under Stephen Ndung’u, as Chief Administrator, commended  Ngilu for the good work she is doing for the people of Kitui, saying this is why they chose to begin their exercise in the county. Team chair Senator Yusuf Haji and Amos Wako (member) said the experience Ngilu got from the National government was helping her do great things for the county. “The task force will not fail Kenyans. We will deliver to our mandate. Our initiative is part of the handshake legacy and we are sure, something good will come out of it,” said Wako.
