Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Housing Finance (HF) Group has reported an after-tax loss of Sh325 million for the period ending September 30, occasioned by low demand for houses and a tough operating environment. Sam Waweru, acting Group managing director, said whereas the loss was attributable to several macroeconomic factors, the group has revamped its strategy to diversify and turnaround the business. He said the firm’s strategy in the past was anchored on real estate and property finance business but is now into diversification, which includes investment in digital and full-service banking capacity in order to grow revenue streams. The firm’s customer deposits for the period increased by 3 per cent to Sh34.6 billion up from Sh33.6 billion registered in 2017. The loans and advances to customers declined by 11 per cent from Sh51.1 billion in 2017 to Sh45.4 billion. “As a result, the firm’s net interest income declined from Shh2.1 billion in 2017 to Sh1.7 billion, attributable to lower loan interest and investment incomes in the current period,” Waweru said.
