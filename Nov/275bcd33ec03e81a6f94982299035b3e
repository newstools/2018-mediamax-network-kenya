Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Two people will today be charged in court after they were found repackaging 500 bales of expired wheat flour from their hideout in Siranga within Nairobi’s Kayole area. The Exe Flour brand that bore the July 2018 shelf life were discovered together with other already repackaged 10 bales of Dola and Golden wheat flour brands. Two suspects Joyce Kamanda, 35, and Samuel Njogu, 45, were arrested. “Detectives yesterday raided a house within Siranga area in Dandora and recovered several bales of expired Exe, Dola  and Golden wheat flour that were being repackaged after expiring in July 2018,” Director of Criminal Investigations George Kinoti said. Yesterday, the case was referred to a multi-agency team for further investigations to establish the  products. The suspects are said to have been targeting the festive season purchase boom to sell to unsuspecting public and potentially endangering lives of consumers. Police are contemplating charging the two with attempted murder. There are fears some of the flour may have already been dispatched to the market for sale, raising questions on how the two obtained the packaging material. In September, Kenya Bureau of Standards and public health officials seized expired cooking oil, rice, sugar and flour worth Sh20 million in Eldoret town.
