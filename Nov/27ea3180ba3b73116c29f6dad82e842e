The Banking Insurance Finance Union (BIFU) is now at liberty to recruit members from the Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA). Appellate Judges Philip Waki, Mohamed Warsame and Agnes Murgor have ruled that the agency failed to comply with the notice by the Registrar of Trade Unions dated July 22, 2004, to implement the check-off system for more than 900 union members. BIFU had been provided with approval by the Minister for Labour and Human Resource Development to receive deductions through the check-off system from its members. The notice in respect of the payment was published in the Kenya Gazette on November 21, 1997. The three-Judge bench pointed out that Section 49 of the repealed Trade Disputes Act required an employer to comply with the registrar’s notice. But KRA failed to accede to the regulation and its reasons for declining to comply were insufficient, the court held. The Appellate bench dismissed the agency’s assertion that the union had not recruited enough members largely because of its rivalry with the Kenya Union of Commercial Food and Allied Workers (KUCFAW). KRA had claimed the union members who had been recruited required to be authenticated for eligibility, as there were employees who have left employment through dismissal, retirement or death, while others were part of management and, therefore, not eligible to join.
