A Mombasa businessman has denied entering into any agreement with Nakuru West MP Samuel Arama for the sale of 0.00557 hectares of land worth more than Sh60 million in 2015. Yusuf Ratemo yesterday told trial magistrate Felix Kombo that he had never owned the disputed property and the postal address appearing on the title deed of Nakuru Municipality block number 6/97. Ratemo denied ever receiving any money from the MP as indicated in the agreement. “I did not receive the amounts indicated on the agreement totaling to Sh45 million or Sh60 million,” said the witness. He was testifying in a case in which Arama and four others are accused of conspiracy to defraud businessman Ahmed Nisar of land worth Sh60 million. “I do not know anything about the transfer form of the plot from myself to Samuel Otara Arama and l have never filled any such form,” he told the court. Ratemo also disowned a signature appearing on the transfer form. “My name, ID number and passport photo were used in the transfers but l did not provide them for the transactions at the land registry,” said the witness. Arama (pictured) is charged with three former Nakuru Lands Registrars John Mwaura, Daniel Nyantika, Charles Birundu and lawyer Kennedy Onkoba. They have denied the charges.
