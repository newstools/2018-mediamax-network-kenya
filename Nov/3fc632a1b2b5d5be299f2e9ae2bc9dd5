Strathmore University increased their chances of winning a maiden Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) men’s Premier League title when they went top of the table following last weekend’s two wins. With the regular season close to completion, Peter Mwathi’s side were unstoppable against Technical University of Kenya (TUK) whom they beat 30-10 on Saturday, Simon Mutuku and Nicholas Munywa, top scoring with five goals apiece. On Sunday, the students registered a 14-goal win over Thika in a 36-22 outcome, victory handing them a three-point lead at the top of the table. The first half was closely contested as Thika kept their defence tight, the match heading to the breather in a 16-10 score in favour of Strathmore. They returned stronger to score 20 goals while Thika managed 12 for the final score count. Winning chances Edgar Wanjala, Maxwell Munene and Antony Muchiri combined for six goals each while Samson Oduor scored four. It was, however, Thika’s Andrew Ndeda who emerged top scorer in the encounter with 10 goals but it was not enough to hand the military side a 10th win. Strathmore have played 17 matches, winning 16 for 32 points and have four matches to play while National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) are second and 29 points. Unbeaten NCPB have six matches to go and any loss will increase Strathmore’s title winning chances. It will, however, not be a walk in the park for the students as they face title contenders Ulinzi, National Youth Service (NYS), Generation and University of Eldoret Pippers. Mwathi’s head-scratcher is definitely the Ulinzi tie which could stand between them and the elusive league title. The soldiers have played 15 matches, losing one to NCPB.
