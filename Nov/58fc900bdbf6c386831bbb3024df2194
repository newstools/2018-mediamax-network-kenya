The Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development (KICD) has assured that the interests of special needs learners will be accommodated in the new curriculum. KICD director Julius Jwan yesterday said the curriculum design for Grade 4 are being adapted to suit learners with special needs, ahead of its rollout in two months’ time. Jwan also stated that the designs referred to as syllabus under the 8-4-4 system of education will guide teachers and publishers when preparing lessons and textbooks for the Competence Based Curriculum (CBC). The new curriculum is being piloted nationally in pre-primary One and Two and Grade One and  Two. “This process has brought on board curriculum implementors who themselves are persons with disabilities,”Jwan said in a statement. One basket The competency based curriculum,  he said, provides an opportunity for learners with special needs to excel in their areas of ability and interest, without feeling neglected. “The 8-4-4 curriculum places all learners in one basket. It doesn’t emphasise on identifying and nurturing talents. The proposed curriculum is out to fix this,” Jwan said. He said teaching and learning materials must be friendly to those with special needs who include the hearing impaired, visually impaired, those with physical impairments as well as learners with intellectual challenges.
