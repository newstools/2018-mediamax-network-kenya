George Odiwuor @PeopleDailyKe National Assembly Leader of Minority John Mbadi yesterday vowed not to accompany Deputy President William Ruto to commission a government project in Homa Bay today. Mbadi said he will boycott the event in Rachuonyo North, because the project in question was not initiated by the Jubilee government. “There is no need for me to accompany Ruto to a project he did not start. The project was started by different regimes of government including the coalition government that was headed by ODM leader Raila Odinga and retired President Mwai Kibaki,” he said. He added that he does not know Ruto’s agenda and, therefore, cannot attend the event. Speaking at Sero Catholic Church in Homa Bay town, the ODM national chairman accused Ruto of extending his 2022 political campaign in Nyanza in disguise of launching government projects. “The Deputy President is not my candidate in the next election. I cannot go where he goes,” he said, adding that he would have accompanied Ruto if he was instructed by Raila.
