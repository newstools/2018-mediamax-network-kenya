Construction of the long-anticipated first-ever airport in Nakuru is expected to start in the coming year after the national and Nakuru county governments settled for Lanet area. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui said they were working closely with Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) to make the capital project to be a reality. He said the airport would be used to transport fresh produce including flowers abroad and tourists keen to visit various tourism centres in Naivasha. “The airport and the planned industrial park in Naivasha will be some of the crucial facilities that will come in handy in wooing investors to the county,” he added. Speaking when the Nakuru International Investment Conference (NIICO) kicked off in Naivasha, Kinyanjui expressed his concern over the unused land in the county. Land owners He said the county would engage large land owners to lease the land for farming to investors as one way of making the country food secure.“There is a ready market for avocado, pyrethrum and dairy products in China and we are keen to tap into that market,” he said. The governor promised that he would work with private partners to increase employment opportunities and wealth for the county and area residents. “In terms of GDP Nakuru county comes third after Nairobi and Kiambu and that is an assurance to area residents that we have funds to spend on various projects,” he said. Addressing the investors, he said his government was working closely with KenGen and Geothermal Development Company to produce cheap power to those companies located in the proposed industrial Park. “The move to extend SGR to Naivasha is a big plus for county and investors and the new US flights will mean a new market for flowers produced in Naivasha,” Kinyanjui said. Investment and Industry Principal Secretary Beth Maina who was the chief guest praised the planned industrial parks, saying the national government fully supported the idea.
