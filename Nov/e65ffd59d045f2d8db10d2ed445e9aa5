AFP and Seth Onyango @PeopleDailyKe A Kenyan priest has been killed in francophone Cameroon’s volatile English-speaking Southwest region where violence has surged after separatists declared an independent state, church sources told AFP on Thursday. “A Kenyan priest was shot dead in Kembong yesterday,” one source said. “There was no fighting, he was in the… church in Kembong when he was killed,” another official said in Buea, capital of the Southwest. The church suggested the priest may have been killed by the military. “There are no ‘Amba Boys’ in Kembong at this moment but the Cameroonian army is there,” one source said, referring to armed separatists fighting for an independent state called Ambazonia. AFP could not independently verify the claim. The priest was working with people displaced by the conflict. It comes just a week after another Kenyan priest, Father Victor Luke Odhiambo, was short and killed by armed militia in South Sudan’s Gok State. According to Gok State in Information Minister John Madol, the incident happened when armed men stormed the compound where he resides. Odhiambo, 62, was the director of a teacher’s training centre run by the Catholic Church in Gok State.
