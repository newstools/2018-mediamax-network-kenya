Police officers will start earning house allowances starting next month, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said yesterday. The move will end a long-standing accommodation crisis within the police service, in what is seen as an early Christmas gift for the officers. Out of the 108,000 police officers, only those in the rank of inspector and above earn house allowances. “Police officers in all ranks will start receiving house allowances next month. They will rent become your neighbours so receive them well,” said Boinnet. Police constables in Nairobi will receive Sh18,124 per month, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Meru and Uasin Gishu Sh13,124 and Sh8,124 for the other counties. The increasing number of police personnel has led to a housing crisis, forcing most officers to share houses. Meanwhile, Boinnet has called on regional police bosses at the Coast to crack the whip and out notorious killer gangs in Kisauni. He said insecurity in the region is of concern because it compromises on tourism. This comes in the wake of crime-related killing of 10 people in the last two weeks.
