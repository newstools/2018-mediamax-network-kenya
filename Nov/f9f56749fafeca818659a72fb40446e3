Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Safaricom’s M-Pesa is holding its ground as the preferred money transfer and payment system despite the entry of other operators in the market, an investment bank says in a new study. Sterling Capital Ltd attributes the lead over rival money transfer services partly to the company’s extensive agency network and multiple mobile money transaction services. The study also says that government’s move to raise excise tax from 10 per cent to 12 per cent and subsequently 20 per cent may not to have any significant impact on the mobile network provider’s market share. Higher fees Renaldo D’Souza, an analyst with Sterling Capital Ltd said despite charging higher fees than its main rivals – Equitel and Airtel – Safaricom has increased transactional value by 96.2 per cent to Sh1.4 trillion by growing M-Pesa customer base to 23.6 million and agents to 156,000. Statistics from the Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) estimates that M-Pesa accounts for 81.2 per cent of total mobile money subscribers, 79.1 per cent of total value of mobile money transactions and 77.2 per cent of total mobile commerce transactions. “M-Pesa continues to hold a high market share in all three metrics in spite of comparatively high transaction fees. For this reason, we conclude that Safaricom has pricing power in mobile money transfer business,” said D’Souza. He said although Safaricom’s mobile money transaction business shares declined from 92.8 per cent in December 2015 to 74.2 per cent in June 2017, it recovered in September 2017 to 80.1 per cent and has since remained stable at 79 per cent.
