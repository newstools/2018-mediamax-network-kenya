Patrick Amunavi @PeopleDailyKe The government has formulated a strategy that seeks to transform Kenya’s agricultural sector into a regional powerhouse. The Agriculture ministry said the Agricultural Sector Transformation and Growth Strategy (ASTGS) will ensure food security through a vibrant and modern sector. Ministry director in charge of knowledge management, technology transfer and capacity building Margaret Makelo said the strategy will strengthen the sector’s contribution to the country’s socio-economic development as envisaged in the Vision 2030, Medium Term Plan III and the Big Four  agenda. She spoke during the official opening of the Scientific, Technological and Industrialisation Conference and Exhibition at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology on Thursday. “The three anchors to drive the 10-year ASTGS are:  to increase small scale farmer, pastoralist and fisherfolk incomes; increase agricultural output and value add; as well as increase household food resilience,” said Makelo. To drive the strategy, she said, the government has identified enablers, including strengthening research and innovation as priority, digitisation and use of data to inform decision-making  as well as actively monitoring and rapidly responding to food system risks such as disease, pests and global price shocks. “We will not only sustainably increase agricultural production and put food on the table, but we will also ensure future generations can continue to benefit from agriculture,” said Makelo.
