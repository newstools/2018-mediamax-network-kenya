Sportpesa Premier League runners-up Bandari FC have raided fellow top-flight side Nzoia Sugar for the services of two players as they seek to go one better and pip champions Gor Mahia to the 2018/2019 title. Despite having the best defence in the concluded season, Bandari have beefed up their back line with the acquisition of solid defender Brian Otieno. The six-foot tall defender helped Nzoia Sugar win the National Super League and gain promotion three years ago and has been the dependable rock in the sugar miller’s defence ever since. Otieno is one of the two defenders to have ever won the player of the month award in the last four years. His performance in the early stages of 2017 season earned him a national team call up although he remains uncapped. His arrival in Mombasa renders the Bandari back line even more formidable as he joins the likes of Felly Mulumba and Duncan Otewa in a defense that conceded the least number of goals last season. “We really struggled last season when Mulumba went out for trials as we did not have sufficient cover in the backline. Midfield players had to be deployed in defense and it was a very difficult time. With Otieno’s arrival we have depth and quality to see us through the upcoming season that is likely to be hectic,” said legendary former Kenyan goalkeeper Wilson Obungu who is currently the Bandari team manager. Bandari have also signed goalkeeper Mustafa Oduor from Nzoia Sugar to understudy first choice Farouk Shikalo. The Bernard Mwalala coached side lost second choice custodian Joseph Okoth to promoted KCB and decided to ship in Oduor as his replacement.
