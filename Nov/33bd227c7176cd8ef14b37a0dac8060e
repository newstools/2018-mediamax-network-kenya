Remanded suspect Joseph Irung’u alias ‘Jowie’  has today withdrawn his application seeking to have high court judge justice James Wakiaga recused from the Monica Kimani murder case. Jowie had written to the Judicial Service Commission seeking to have the case transferred to another judge accusing Wakiaga for making disparaging remarks when he denied him bail. Meanwhile,the court directed the prosecution to allow Jowie’s co-accused journalist Jacque Maribe access to her house, a day  after filing an application accusing the DPP of being in contempt of court.
