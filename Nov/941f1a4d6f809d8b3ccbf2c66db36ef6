Kinyuru Munuhe  @kinyurumunuhe Meru Senator Mithika Linturi risks being cited for contempt of court following yesterday’s scuffle with his besieged companion Maryanne Jebet Keitany at their Runda home hours after Keitany obtained orders restraining him from visiting their house. Linturi went to his home after the confrontation reportedly erupted. However, by yesterday evening, no official complaint had been reported at Runda Police Station in connection with the incident. “The two had a scuffle before the politician left,” a security official said.  Keitany obtained restraining orders against the politician giving her exclusive occupation to their palatial Runda residence where the duo lived before marital disagreements rocked the two. The interim orders restrained Linturi  “from physically or sexually abusing or threatening to abuse the applicant, the applicant’s staff, their six children and/or any other person associated with the applicant.” Hell broke loose after Keitany reported to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations that Linturi threatened to shoot her following a domestic brawl.
