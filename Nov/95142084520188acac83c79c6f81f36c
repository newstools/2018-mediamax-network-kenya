Barry Silah @obel_barry Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) is in crisis following the notification of two parallel league events in Kakamega and Mwingi this week. The confusion follows the emergence of two factions, one under secretary general Isaac Mbote and another led by outgoing BAK boss John Kameta. Sources suggest there is deep mistrust and growing discontent between both camps which is seen as a pointer to a bigger internal problem within BAK. Speaking to People Sport on phone from Western Kenya, Mbote was categorical that the boxing event will go on as planned because it was ‘properly’ arranged and that ‘registered’ officials will oversee it. “As far as we are concerned, our schedule is on. Ten teams have already confirmed participation so we are good to go. There has been no court order to alter or stop our programme,” said Mbote. Mbote and his backers, including BAK first vice-president Albert Matito and treasurer George Onyango have in the meantime gone to the Sports Registrar to seek an interpretation of the eligibility of BAK. “We want this body deregistered and a caretaker committee formed to take charge in keeping with the constitution. As it stands, BAK is not recognised legally and we therefore ask to get the requisite constitutional amendments so that certain individuals of influence stop holding the sport to ransom. There is also an urgent need to call elections in keeping with the demands of the Sports Act 2013,” said Mbote. However, in a quick rejoinder, Kameta accused his opponents of acting in contravention of the law since the calendar had been drawn last year. “The group the ones actually ‘banned’ from BAK are orchestrating sabotage. It is unethical and unprofessional because the fourth leg had been planned for Mwingi and not Kakamega. I am not an impediment and I am looking forward to a smooth transition when the elections come up in January,” said Kameta.
