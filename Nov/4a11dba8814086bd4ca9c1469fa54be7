Irene Githinji and Mathew Ndung’u @gitshee Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed has reiterated that the marking procedure for Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination will detect even the slightest form of cheating. She told centre managers, examination officials and candidates that the government will continue to put in place additional measures to detect any form of irregularities, even after examinations are over. Speaking in Garissa yesterday where she monitored the examination that is on its 10th day, Amina said they will deliver a credible examination at whatever cost. “The examination process has been executed in a well-planned and coordinated way, which has ensured that no papers have leaked,” she said. She said the government this week introduced rules to complement those issued earlier, including a fresh audit of all registration details of candidates in every exam centre. At the same time, Education Permanent secretary Belio Kipsang emphasised the need to create adequate confidence among teaching professionals to reduce huge investment during examinations delivery. “With professionalism in handling national exams, we shall no longer make exams extremely high stakes. We all have a role to play in accomplishing this,” he said.
