An acute drug shortage has forced the Kakamega County Referral Hospital to stop dialysis and cancer treatment. People Daily learnt yesterday the National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) cardholders who constitute the main clientele at the cancer centre and renal unit are not guaranteed treatment without digging deeper into their pockets for drugs. Mary Nekesa, who was seeking out-patient services for blood pressure, said the card served her at the laboratory and consultation room but lack of drugs at the hospital pharmacy forced her to pay cash for the prescribed medicines. The hospital medical superintendent Victor Zimbulu was unavailable for comment but the head of the pharmacy Mike Watamba confirmed the shortage. “We made a requisition for medical supplies last August. The available drug stock then could take us just one month but no deliveries have been made to date,” he said, blaming the delay on bureaucratic and centralised procurement.
