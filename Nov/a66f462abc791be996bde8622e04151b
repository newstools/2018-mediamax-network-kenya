BRIDE: TERESA NJERI GROOM: PATRICK MBURU DATE: JULY 7, 2018 VENUE: PCEA RUAI PHOTOGRAPHY: WILLY MUTURI PHOTOGRAPHY HAIR: KEVIN AFROSIRI MAKE-UP: LORNA MUTEGI MC: MC JOE What did you consider when choosing your wedding venue? Patrick: We chose Ruai for both the church and reception because it was the most convenient venue for family and friends, and they are dear to us. We wanted somewhere easily accessible. Your Ankara outfits were beautiful. How did you choose the theme of your wedding? We started off with two colours from a flower that was white and yellow; my wife loves white and yellow. But, since we had an African theme, we later settled on the colours of the African print we got, since it included the main colour, which was yellow. She still got to have her colour (laughs). The men’s designer we worked with (Mjukuu) was not afraid to experiment. I bought into his idea of having two outfits for the day and it worked well. How long did it take you to plan the wedding and how did you plan? It took us a year, with the help of a committee that started in May last year. It was a good experience. God blessed us with people with different skill sets. How did you settle on the number of guests? We based it on the number of our family members, friends and church members. For our bridal party, we wanted a manageable number to work with. Why would you say your wedding was successful? Because we saw God fulfilling His promises to us in front of our very own eyes. We were finally tying the knot. What was most memorable about your big day? Without a doubt, it was seeing her walking down the aisle. Teresa: It is when Patrick’s parents handed him over to me. In addition, seeing how all the colours blended well.
