Alvin Mwangi  @PeopleDailyKe Water Cabinet secretary Simon Chelugui has urged Water Resources ministers in Intergovernmental Authority for Development (Igad) member states to make water an enabling pillar of socio-economic development. Speaking yesterday during a ministerial meeting on issues around trans-boundary waters, he urged the ministers to fast-track ending of the stalemate that has been the surrounding management of water resources, saying it was hindering development. “As Igad member states we should engage on how to work together and manage water resources,” he said. The CS cited lack of information and management of the available water resources as the biggest cause of conflicts. He said there’s need to have joint legal and institutional frameworks for proper coordination of the water resources among the states. The ministers agreed to develop measures of harvesting rainwater as water resources are decreasing because of harsh climatic conditions and increased economic activities along the catchment areas.
