Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi The government will not relent the war on radicalisation and terrorism until it ensures national security and safety, President Uhuru Kenyatta assured yesterday. He also lauded the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) for unwavering service to the country in the wake of threats posed by external forces. Speaking during the passing out parade at the Recruits’ Training School at Moi Barracks in Eldoret, the President maintained that his government will continue to retain KDF troops in Somalia due to threats posed by al Shabaab militia until lasting peace is attained in the war-torn country. The troops, he said, will not return until Somalia attains sustainable peace and stability. “I continue to laud efforts of KDF in the fight against terrorism both in Somalia and at home as part of the multi-agency forces currently in Boni Forest,” he said, adding that the country has lost some gallant soldiers in the line of duty. The President was accompanied by Defence Cabinet Secretary Raychelle Omamo, the Chief of Defence Forces General Samson Mwathethe, service commanders and Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago among other dignitaries. He urged Kenyans to support KDF in their quest to fight security challenges perpetrated by terror groups targeting innocent Kenyans. “Terrorism is still a major threat and my government is determined to eliminate,” said Uhuru.
