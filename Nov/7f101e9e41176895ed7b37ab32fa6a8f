Murder suspect Joseph Irungu, alias Jowie, yesterday withdrew an application to have High Court judge James Wakiaga recuse himself from hearing the Monica Kimani murder case. The same court also allowed Jowie’s co-accused, TV presenter Jacque Maribe, access to her house and key witness statements. The judge, however, denied her access to her car and mobile phone. This comes a day after Maribe filed a contempt of court application seeking to have the Director of Public Prosecutions and Director of Criminal Investigations jailed for failing to allow her access her house. Through his lawyer David Ayuo, Irungu told the court that he did not wish to proceed with the application in which he had accused the judge of bias against him. Woman eater “The application to have me recuse is withdrawn and the letter to the application addressed to the Judicial Service Commission to remove me as High Court judge annexed to the application has been expunged from the court records,’’ ruled the judge. Irungu had filed an application to have Justice Wakiaga recuse himself after he called him a “woman eater” during a bail application ruling. He told the judge that he had made his application without due consideration. “The application to have you recuse from the matter was made in a rush and we seek to withdraw the application and the letter annexed to it. We will be writing to JSC to have the same letter withdrawn,”said Irungu’s lawyer. Justice Wakiaga further ordered that the accused be admitted to Kenyatta National Hospital to enable him to undergo a scheduled surgery on a gunshot wound.
