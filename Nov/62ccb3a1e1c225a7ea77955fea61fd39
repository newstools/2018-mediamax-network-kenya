Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) vice chief Lt General Robert Kibochi has assured that the enlisting of 3,000 eligible Kenyans to the military will be above board. He spoke yesterday during the launch of this year’s second recruitment at the Department of Defence (DoD) headquarters in Nairobi. “All recruiting teams are in their respective recruitment centres and the exercise will be conducted in accordance with the KDF Act,” he said. There are 322 recruiting centres in all sub-counties across the country, overseen by 16 recruiting teams. Kibochi warned that those found engaging in malpractices such as bribery or presenting fake academic documents would face the law. The 30-day exercise will begin next week. Kibochi said out of the targeted 3,000 recruits, they expect at least 300 women in line with the KDF gender mainstreaming policy and as per the Constitution. Last year, President Uhuru Kenyatta launched the Defence ministry Gender Policy and the National Defence Policy at National Defence College to shape Kenya’s military strategy formulation. DoD has enforced measures to deter recruitment malpractices, including presenting original national identity cards (ID) and academic certificates.
