George Odiwuor @PeopleDailyKe Trouble for embattled Homa Bay county Assembly Speaker  Elizabeth Ayoo worsened yesterday after her office was sprayed with some unknown chemicals and  furniture vandalised. The Speaker also found her new plastic chairs and a table,  bought on Tuesday after the ones she had were taken away,  broken by unknown people. Forensic analysis Police officers and detectives who went to the office for forensic analysis claimed the chemical was tiatrics—used for controlling pests on livestock. The chemical is said to be poisonous. Ayoo blamed security guards within the Assembly who she accused of laxity.  “The Assembly premises is surrounded by guards and police officers. I do not know why they don’t report destruction cases within the House,” she said. The Speaker was forced to work from her secretary’s office as corridors leading to the office were manned by private security guard Kwabwai MCA Richard Ogindo and his Kanyamwa Kosewe counterpart Nicholas Owaka claimed  spraying of chemicals in the office was an assassination attempt. Ogindo blamed some Assembly staff who he accused of leading the attacks on the Speaker. Owaka said MCAs risk losing their seats if the fight at the Assembly is not resolved soon. “Our opponents will use this as a strategy to campaign against us. They will say we failed to do what took us to the Assembly,” he said. “We still have time to change. We have only spent about one year in office after election. We just need to improve our working relations,” said Owaka. Meanwhile, the Assembly remained a ghost place from Monday after workers reportedly withdrew their services. Most offices were locked and residents who went to the Assembly to seek services were turned back at the main gate. The Assembly sittings were adjourned indefinitely on Tuesday afternoon after some members said their lives were in danger.
