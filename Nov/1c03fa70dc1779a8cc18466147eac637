Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Maize farmers in the North Rift have turned down requests by maize millers to buy their produce at Sh1,500 per 90kg bag in the wake of bumper harvest in the region. The farmers from Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Nandi and Elgeyo Marakwet counties vowed to stick to their demand for a better price. Kimutai Kolum, one of the farmers in Uasin Gishu said they have been approached by millers but have disagreed over the price. “The millers want to exploit us by offering between Sh1,200 and Sh1,500 per 90kg  bag but  we want Sh3,400 per bag,” he  said. “We have resolved not to dispose of our produce to the millers and brokers,” said Daniel Chemwolo another  farmer from Elgeyo Marakwet. Speaking to the press in Eldoret, the millers, who were led by Ineet Maize Millers chairman Kenneth Mutai said they will not allow farmers to dictate  the produce prices since the market is already flooded with imported cheap maize.
