Curtains come down on the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) Handball Association’s annual Chief of Defence Forces (CDF) championship today as holders Fourth Brigade (4th BDE) and Second Brigade (2nd BDE) defend their titles in the men’s and women’s categories respectively. The championship, which threw off on November 19, had brought together 12 men’s and eight women’s teams from the various formations pooled in two groups for each category. Fourth Brigade fought off stiff competition from Moi Airbase (MAB) in the semi-finals to pick a narrow two-goal win in an 18-16 outcome. Mark Mutuku and Abel Weru top scored for the eventual winners with six and five goals respectively. MAB’s onslaught was led by Noah Cheruiyot with seven goals but it was not enough to hand them the finals berth. In the other men’s semi-final, Kahawa Garrison had Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league star Nicholas Ireri, Fred Pepela and Kellion Otieno to thank for a 30-24 win against hosts Artillery as they scored six goals apiece. Frank Kiplagat was the match’s top scorer with 10 goals but it was not enough to help the hosts in to the finals. En route to the finals, the holders had kept an unbeaten run scoring 116 goals and allowing in 67 to top pool A. The other finalists, Kahawa, also went unbeaten scoring 123 goals against 78. Meanwhile, in the women’s category, Second Brigade saw off Kahawa 28-22 to book a finals spot where they will fight to retain the title. They are up against hosts Artillery, who thrashed Engineers Brigade from Thika 24-12, in the other semi-final. The women’s final will be a spectacle as the two sides were grouped in Pool B where the hosts finished top of the group with a three-match win while the holders finished second. Artillery won the group stage clash by 25 goals to 18.
