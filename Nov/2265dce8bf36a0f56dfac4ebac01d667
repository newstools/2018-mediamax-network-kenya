Emmanule Masinde Former world cross-country champion Agnes Tirop and reigning world Under-20 10,000m winner Rhonex Kipruto ruled the roost at the 11th edition of Tuskys Wareng cross-country event held in Eldoret yesterday. In a windy morning, Tirop, who faced stiff competition from former Africa 3,000m steeplechase champion Norah Jeruto and former world 2,000m steeplechase champion Sandra Chebet, shrugged off the challenges to emerge victorious in a time of 33:14.5 ahead of Jeruto (33:34.8) and Chebet’s 33:37.4. Tirop took the lead with 2km remaining and never looked back in a race she used as part of her build-up towards next year’s world cross-country championships slated for Denmark where she seeks to defend her title. Victory “I am happy to have won today, though it was not easy. I have trained for three months and I was in good shape,” said Tirop. In the men’s senior race, Kipruto, who missed the world 10km road race title by two seconds, also took off from the rest of the pack with 2km remaining, opening up a gap that his rivals could not close as he claimed victory in 29:38.1 ahead of new comers Davis Kimeli (29:55.9) and Shadrack Kimutai (30:07.3) who took second and third respectively. “This was part of my training as I head for a series of cross-country events across the world,” said Kipruto. Beatrice Chebet won the women’s 6km junior race after timing 20:20.53 ahead of Edina Jebitok (20:38.23) who finished second as Immaculate Chepkirui (20:31.19) finished third while Tecla Loroupe Peace race winner Michael Kibet claimed the men’s 8km event in 23:51.1 ahead of second-placed Bravin Kogei (24:81.22) and third-placed Charles Kakuri’s 24:03.4.
