Tom Rachuonyo A family in Uriri Constituency in Migori County spent  the night in the cold after their house was  set on fire by suspected arsonists on allegations of witchcraft. Villagers suspected that arsonists acting on allegations of witchcraft set on fire houses in one homestead following accusation that 15 relatives had been be-witched and died mysteriously. Mzee Ouma Seka’s family had to spend the night at St Mary’s Uriri Catholic Church after an irate mob pounced on their home burning four houses with all personal belongings intact. The family also lost several chickens and a German shepherd dog that were all collected from the compound and thrown into the burning houses. Trouble started when a reknowned Tanzanian spiritualist, referred to as only  Prophet Ogwang’, allegedly found an embalmed human arm believed to have been used by the family for ages to kill their relatives. According to eye-witnesses, after the embalmed human arm was found in one of the family houses, the mob went wild threatening to kill the alleged owners, forcing an armed security team from Uriri Police Station to shoot in the air and use teargas to rescue the family from the irate mob that were baying to lynch them alongside their houses and property. However, 87-year-old Mzee Seka and his ageing wife were injured in the melee before police rushed them to Uriri dispensary where they were treated and discharged. Uriri sub-county OCPD Daniel Mwanzia said they had launched investigations into the incident and will take appropriate action against the perpetrators.
