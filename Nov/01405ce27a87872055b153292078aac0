The silent wars between the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) played out on Wednesday evening after the latter attempted to arrest detectives attached to Kabete Police Station over Sh1 million bribery allegations. The two agencies have been on a collision path over the overlapping mandates in the fight against corruption leading to blame game in execution of their respective mandates. Besides undertaking parallel investigations on similar matters creating overlaps in their mandates, both DCI’s office and EACC for example, handle anti-corruption and economic crimes anti-money laundering cases, organised crimes and procurement cases although the DCI has a broader mandate. As part of the multi-agency team which also includes EACC, DCI George Kinoti and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji have clearly been projecting a close working relationship especially in the fight against corruption. Yesterday, the EACC detectives were mooting strategy to force Kinoti hand over two officers attached to Kabete Police Station. Julius Oguma and Charles Macharia allegedly demanded Sh1million bribe from a Chinese identified as Gong Huan held at the station for lack of proper documentation. Huan is held alongside robbery suspect Ali Axley. Four EACC officers laid a trap to arrest the two at Kabete Police canteen but their colleagues fired in the air to facilitate their escape. The Eacc sleuths were allowed to search the two and Oguma’s vehicle but no money was recovered. By yesterday evening, two officers wanted by the anti-graft body over bribery claims are yet to be arrested. But EACC spokesperson Yassin Amaro disputed claims that their officers had not identified themselves , insisting that the DCI detectives were out to protect one of their own who had solicited a Sh1 million bribe.
