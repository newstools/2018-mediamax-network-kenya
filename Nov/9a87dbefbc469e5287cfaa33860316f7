Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has suspended the trading of Deacons (East Africa) Plc shares at the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) following the appointment of joint administrators by the board of the company to run its business. “Notice is hereby given on the suspension in trading of Deacons (East Africa) Plc shares following the appointment of joint administrators by the Board of the company to run its business in accordance with the Insolvency Act of No 18 of 2015,” CMA said in an advertisement. The suspension was issued in pursuant to Regulation 22(2) of the Capital Markets (Securities) (Public Offers, Listings and Disclosures) Regulations, 2002. The suspension in trading of the company’s shares took effect from yesterday and shall remain in force for 40 working days. Shareholders, investors and the general public were advised to take note of the suspension. On August 20, CMA suspended the trading of Kenya’s ARM Cement three days after it had been put under administration. According to CMA, about eight firms listed on NSE are facing liquidity and corporate governance challenges that have seen their earnings drop significantly. The share prices of some firms have fallen below the par value, putting investors’ wealth at risk. Analysts say some firms share prices have dropped into the negative working capital territory, where their short-term assets are not adequate to cover short-term liabilities when they fall due, making it difficult to finance their day-to-day operations.
