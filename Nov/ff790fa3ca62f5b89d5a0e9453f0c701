Commission for University Education (CUE) chairman Prof Chacha Nyaigotti has urged universities operating on interim letters of authority to implement proposals contained in their respective inspection reports. He said this is the only way to ensure learning in the institutions is not disrupted as they await the award of charters. At the same time, the CUE boss cautioned some universities, which are operating on interim letters of authority after exceeding their operational duration, saying it is contravention of the Universities Act.  “The law requires that a university be awarded a charter at least after four years from the date they are issued with the interim letters of authority,” he said. According to the commission’s statistics, 14 universities are operating on letters of interim authority. The oldest university under this category is Aga Khan University established in 2002 while the youngest is Amref University which was opened last year. Prof Nyaigotti, who spoke Friday during Management University of Africa’s (MUA) 5th graduation ceremony, lauded the institution, saying it had made tremendous progress towards the award of a charter. “MUA has aligned itself with the reforms envisioned by CUE. It has exhibited growth in academic programmes, students’ enrollment as well as corresponding growth of infrastructure at the University’s main Campus in Kisaju, Kajiado county,” he said. MUA Vice Chancellor Nicholas Letting said construction of the university’s main campus is nearing completion and will be opened next year. The Chancellor Reuben Mutiso urged the graduates to utilise the development funds availed by the government to create self-employment.
