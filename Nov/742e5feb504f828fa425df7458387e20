Deputy President William Ruto has stepped up the campaign to have MPs pass the two third gender bill in Parliament on Tuesday even a section of male MPs lobby their colleagues toÂ  shoot it down when it comes to the floor of the house. The bill which is now in the second reading, has had a tumultus history having been shot down in 2016 on the floor of the house. The constitution of Kenya Amendment Bill, 2018, sponsored by National Assembly majority leader Aden Duale, is seeking to ensure parliament complies with the crucial two-thirds gender principle.
