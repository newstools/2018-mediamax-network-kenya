Bridget Ondu More than 400 families were Friday morning left homeless after their houses were demolished at Mwendo wa Panya village in Kilifi county. The squatters were evicted from the land they were living on by the owners with the aid of police, following a court order. The affected claimed they were evicted without notice and a court case on the land ownership had not been concluded. Residential houses, churches and a school are among structures that were brought down. Fauzia Katana, a widow, said she was unable to salvage any household properties and was concerned that her son, who will be sitting Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) examination, has no place to live. John Waweru, Mark Mwaura and Peter Mwangi, who claim to be the legal owners of the land, had filed a case against Michael Konde and 28 others at Malindi High Court in 2012 seeking the eviction of illegal settlers on their six-acre piece of land. Kilifi Police commander Fredrick Ochieng said they received and verified the court order signed on May 14  by Malindi High Court Deputy Registrar before serving the defendants on July 19. He added that he gave the defendants a 14-day notice to move out. “They were aware of the evictions and they should respect the law. We have not received any subsequent order to prohibit the eviction,” he said.
