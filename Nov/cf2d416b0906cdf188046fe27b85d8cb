Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Malava politician Mark Luchivya, who died in a road accident on the Eldoret-Nakuru highway last Tuesday afternoon, will be buried on Friday. Family spokesman Joshua Masitsa, an uncle to the deceased, told People Daily Luchivya will be buried at his home in Kitale. Malava MP Malulu Injendi was yesterday expected to preside over a fundraiser while his Cherang’any counterpart, Joshua Kuttuny, is today scheduled to drive a Harambee at Legacy in Kitale to offset burial expenses. Luchivya (pictured), an unsuccessful parliamentary candidate for Malava constituency, Kakamega county in the 2013 General Election, died last week while travelling to Eldoret from Nairobi. He previously served as District Education Officer in Turkana, Meru and Trans-Nzoia counties before he resigned to plunge into elective politics where he unsuccessfully contested against incumbent Malulu. The deceased is the elder brother of Milele FM radio presenter Francis Luchivya. His body will be moved from the Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary in Eldoret tomorrow for an overnight vigil at his home before being ferried to Kitale for the final funeral rites.
