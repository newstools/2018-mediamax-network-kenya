Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairperson Wafula Chebukati has claimed that a petition presented to Parliament seeking his removal from office is fuelled by malice and bitterness. Speaking in Mombasa yesterday during a forum to review last year’s poll, Chebukaki claimed the petitioner, Seth Panyako, wants to evade paying election petition costs slapped on him by the High Court in Kakamega after he failed to successfully challenge the election of Senator Cleophas Malala. Chebukaki said Panyako should not be allowed to “use Parliament to fight his political wars”. “The allegations made therein on the validity or otherwise of the gazetted results in respect of Malala’s election, is in our view misplaced, misdirected and lacks substance,” he said. The petition has been filed before the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee and has been received by the Clerk of the National Assembly.  Panyako wants Chebukati ousted for alleged role in an illegality during last year’s polls.
