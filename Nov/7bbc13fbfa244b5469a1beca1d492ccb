Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah Kenya Forest Service (KFS) has stepped up restoration efforts in the Mau Forest Complex—the country’s biggest water tower—with more than five million trees set to be planted during the November-December rains. Speaking yesterday, KFS Mau Head of Conservancy, Fred Ogombe said  they plan  to plant the seedlings at Kiptunga Forest, which is part of the larger Mau Forest Complex. Kiptunga is also the source of water for Mara River. Out of the 20,000 hectares of the forest that was degraded and encroached, KFS have managed to rehabilitate 7,000 hectares in the last three years. Ogombe said the exercise is ongoing until  their target is reached. Green Belt Movement  chairperson Marion Kamau urged Kenyans not to leave conservation efforts to corporate and private organisations but to also participate as  individuals. “Over the past years, the government has pushed for forest conservation, I believe most Kenyans are now well informed on forest matters especially the dangers of destroying such natural resources,” she said and urged Kenyans to jealously guard resources that will benefit generations to come.
