DERBY goalkeeper Scott Carson has has Sh10.5m (£80,000) Range Rover stolen… just weeks after having his wallet nicked. The former England No1, 33, had his wallet and wash bag pinched from the car last month in a cruel twist of fate. Carson has now taken to Twitter to confirm the news, with his black Range Rover Sport, worth around £80,000, yet to be returned. Carson tweeted: “If my wallet and wash bag wasn’t enough, woke up this morning with no car on the drive. “Both keys in my hands. Black Range Rover sport.” It comes as a double-blow to the Rams stopper, who just last month was forced to tweet again after having the possessions of his car stolen. At the time, Carson wrote: “Stupidly left my car open last night with my wallet in it. “Some scumbag at 10pm, while I was in bed was going through my car and took my wallet. “Thankfully they closed the car door that hard I was able to realise and cancel my cards.” Carson – a four-cap Three Lions star – has played 21 times for Derby this season under Frank Lampard as they aim to break back into the Premier League.
