The union of the coastal council of elders has called on authorities to fast-track investigations into the alarming rate of teenage pregnancies witnessed in the region as shocking statistics continue to emerge. Alarmed by the ballooning cases of pregnant school girls, the elders yesterday urged for government commitment to reverse the trend. Led by Mijikenda community council of elders secretary general Vincent Mwachiro, the elders said they are in support of government efforts to ban night discos terming it as a recipe to immorality. “We are concerned as elders and that is why we are in support of government efforts to eradicate the issue,” said Mwachiro during a media briefing  in Mombasa. At the same time, the Kenya Film and Classification Board (KFCB) coast regional boss Bonventure Kioko warned the agency will next week crack down on holiday villas which have been accused of allowing sex tourism to thrive. “We have asked guest houses, lodgings  and villas recorded as holiday homes to register all their visitors including their ages and place of origin so that we can be able to trace those who lure children to this hotels,” said Kioko.
