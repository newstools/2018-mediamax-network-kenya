Flower farms in the country face closure in the coming months following an acute shortage of fertiliser that has affected their operations and seen some farmers scale down production. At risk are the more than 150,000 workers who are employed directly with stakeholders pointing fingers at Kenya Bureau of standards (Kebs) for the current crisis after holding back more than 1.6 metric tonnes for inspection. The Kenya Flower Council (KFC) and the Agriculture Employers Association have petitioned the President to intervene. According to KFC, the country flower production could fall sharply due to the crisis that had persisted for the last five months with necessary government agencies ignoring the crisis. KFC chief executive Clement Tulezi admitted that the sector was on its knees with more than 1.6 million tonnes of fertiliser awaiting inspection at the port by Kenya Bureau of Standards (Kebs). Speaking in Naivasha over the weekend, Tulezi termed the horticulture sector as very sensitive noting that failure to supply the fertiliser could lead to a drop in quantity and quality. “At the moment there are more than 750,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser being held by Elgon Kenya and another 880,000 in Yala awaiting inspection by Kebs,” he said. The CEO said that the problem started after Kebs moved in to reignin contraband goods adding that farmers were confident of where they sourced their fertiliser. He added that farmers were currently facing cash flow challenges as Kenya Revenue Authority had failed to refund Sh5 billion  owed to farmers in VAT refunds. “The current challenges coupled with high labour wages and lack of support from the State has led to job losses despite this sector earning the country a whopping Sh82 billion in the last financial year,” he said.
