 Vetting of 14 candidates vying for the position of EACC chief executive will  commence today amid claims the process has been hijacked to favour certain individuals. People Daily has learnt that power barons, keen to ensure the anti-graft watchdog remains a lame duck, are working to skew the process in favour of individuals who will do their bidding. It has emerged here is intense backroom lobbying to ensure the ex-CEO Halakhe Waqo’s replacement maintains the status quo. A source privy to the intrigues at the commission intimated that chairman Eliud Wabukala has been unable to insulate the vetting process from external interest.
