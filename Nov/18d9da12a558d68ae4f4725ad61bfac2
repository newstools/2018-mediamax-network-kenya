Parties in a dispute are free to voluntarily negotiate out-of-court settlements even if the matter is already in court, the Supreme Court has ruled. The principle of finality and utility of consent judgments are essential in the effective administration of justice where warring parties participate in resolving court cases, the highest court in the land held yesterday. “Courts must respect mutual agreements to settle cases, some of which have taken inordinately long time. Where parties had chosen to negotiate and settle their disputes, courts have no right to insist on hearing and determining cases,” the court ruled. “The fact that a judgment is ready for delivery cannot justify denial to litigants the opportunity to explore Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms. Unless obtained through coercion and fraud, courts ought to respect consents as impartial arbiters to disputes.” The Supreme Court made the ruling in a dispute referred to it by prominent businessman Geoffrey Asanyo after the Court of Appeal rejected to record a consent reached by parties in a commercial dispute. Instead, the Appellate Bench substituted the settlement with its own judgment. On July 20, the Court of Appeal upheld the election of Mandera Senator Mohamed Mohamud and rejected an application by his political rival Hassan Osman to belatedly withdraw his petition. Lawyer Anthony Lubulellah had informed Justice Martha Koome that the parties had successfully negotiated and signed an agreement for endorsement by the court. However, the judge ruled that a decision must be pronounced once an appeal had been lodged and heard to its conclusion. “Once you have engaged the court, there is nothing more to be done,” she said.
