What is your latest gadget? I recently purchased a Tecno Camon CX smartphone and I like it. I was on iOS before, but I like the android even more. What would you choose between an expensive mobile phone and a nice camera? Mmmh… This is a tricky question because to me, good images are life. But for now an expensive phone will do. Actually, an expensive phone with a nice camera would be the perfect purchase. So, why would you prefer an android phone to an iPhone? Since I started using the Tecno Camon CX, I realised android phones are user friendly. They have an easy operating mode as compared to iPhones. I am now a convert! What gadget do you use mostly at home and why? That has to be my phone. A huge chunk of my work involves a lot of online engagement and communication and nothing else comes through like the phone. Which app do you mostly use on your phone? The Notebook. I note my to-do list for the day there and tick as I get things done and I do love taking notes. I take notes everywhere, so the Notebook tops the list of my most used phone applications. What would you be if you were a gadget? I would be a radio; I am a sanguine! I am optimistic or positive, especially in an apparently bad or difficult situation and talking is a part of me. What is the worst gadget you have ever had and why? I once owned a Samsung flip phone, whose screen and network signal kept going off. The battery life was also too short. Let’s just say it was so frustrating. I used to get so angry! What is that one gadget you cannot stay without and why? I cannot stay without my phone. As a music publicist, I spend a lot of time communicating to people, be it the artistes, media and producers, among others. And that is where the phone comes in handy.
