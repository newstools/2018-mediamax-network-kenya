Munich, Thursday Bayern Munich chief Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has slammed Juventus for splashing £100 million (Sh13 billion) on Cristiano Ronaldo. The Serie A champions smashed the Italian transfer record to sign the Portuguese star from Real Madrid last month despite him recently turning 33. Rummenigge can understand why Juve were so determined to land Ronaldo after catching wind Madrid were willing to sell, but he insisted they paid over the odds considering his age. “Ronaldo? I was surprised by the fact that Andrea Agnelli decided to make this deal happen, but from Juve’s point of view it makes sense,” the Bayern chief executive told Merkur. He added: “Italian football has lost ground in recent years, but we’d never invest all that money on a 33-year-old player.” Bayern Munich have only spent £17 million (Sh2.2 billion) so far this summer and that was sanctioned with one eye on the future after 17-year-old Canadian sensation Alphonso Davies joined from Vancouver last month. Rummenigge believes success does not need to be bought and pointed to Madrid’s blueprint—which has seen them invest little for a return of three consecutive Champions League triumphs—as evidence. The 62-year-old admitted he has been astonished by the amount of money spent on players around Europe in the past few seasons, but knows who to blame for prices blowing up. “If prices are inflated then the fault lies with Manchester City and Paris Saint-Germain. There’s no need to go crazy to win the Champions League. Just look at what Real Madrid have done in the last few years without spending almost anything and this is also our philosophy,” he added. -DAILYMAIL
