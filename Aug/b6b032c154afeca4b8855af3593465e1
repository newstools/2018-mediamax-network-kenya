In the continuing push to determine who sold land in the Mau forest that has now left thousands of its former occupants homeless, 15 group ranch officials, 3 surveyors and 3 land registrars have been put on the wanted list for allegedly selling land to members of the public illegally. Those on the run have been asked to surrender themselves to police or else face the full force of the law.
