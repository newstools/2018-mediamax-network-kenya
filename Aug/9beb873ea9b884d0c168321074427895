A simmering row at the Anglican church in West Pokot county that has persisted for over 25 years is threatening to split the church further after a section of the members staged a protest demanding the approval of the  proposed Kapenguria  diocese. This comes three days after the ACK church appointed Dr. Emanuel Chemetich as  bishop of the Kitale diocese.
