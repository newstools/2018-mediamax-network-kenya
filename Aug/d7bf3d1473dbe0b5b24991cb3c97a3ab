Despite the buzz around him and socialite Vera Sidika, Otile Brown has his eyes also set on business. Otile who is riding high with his latest song Baby Love, bought a Honda Hybrid which he says will be for business. “Shout out to my boy Mwangi St Patrick for getting me this new Honda for business at a fair price. Baddest car dealer in the game. Now let’s wait for that baby,” he posted on his Instagram account.
