Paris, Thursday @PeopleSports11 Zinedine Zidane is interested in managing Manchester United and wants to succeed Jose Mourinho as early as next season, according to reports in France. The French legend left Real Madrid at the end of last season after completing a hat-trick of successive Champions League successes and has yet to take another post. Zidane was linked with the France manager’s job but Didier Deschamps decided to continue in the role following their World Cup triumph. Now, according to French newspaper L’Equipe, Zidane has set his sights on a Premier League post and is especially keen on United. Mourinho is entering his third season in the Old Trafford hotseat but the campaign follows a tumultuous pre-season in which the manager regularly complained about missing out on transfer targets. His relationship with the club’s executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward has deteriorated and Mourinho cut a frustrated figure throughout the summer. He left Chelsea shortly after completing his third season during his first spell and three seasons proved his limit both at Real Madrid and in his second Chelsea spell. United did win their opening Premier League fixture 2-1 against Leicester City on Friday evening but Mourinho has already made clear his belief he doesn’t have the squad to challenge reigning champions Manchester City. World Cup winner Zidane, 46, already has a sparkling managerial CV having won three Champions League titles with Real, as well as La Liga, the UEFA Super Cup twice and the FIFA Club World Cup twice.                           -DAILYMAIL
