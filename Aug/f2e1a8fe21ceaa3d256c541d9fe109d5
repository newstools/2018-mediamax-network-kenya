He said, “This screening and opportunity to meet the stars we see on TV is our way of appreciating your support as we endeavor to improve your interactions with us on both our DStv and GOtv platforms.” Selina is a classic Cinderella-like tale that combines the romance of the fairy tale with the relevant social issue of educating the girl child. It depicts the life of Selina, a 19-year-old girl, who goes to work in a wealthy city home after being brainwashed by her step-mother, Kristina, who has convinced her to leave her family and education behind and instead work as a housemaid in order to support her family, her sickly father and her younger step-brother and sister. As fate would have it, she falls in love with the youngest son of the house where she is deployed to work.
