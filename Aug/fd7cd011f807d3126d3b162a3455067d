A section of muslim leaders, who joined other faithful around the country, in observing Eid-Ul-Adha celebrations, have criticised  majority leader Aden Duale, over his remarks on chief Kadhi Sheikh Murdhar, accusing him of  allegedly trying to divide the  Muslim faithful.
The leaders led by former Mombasa senator Hassan Omar, termed Duale’s statement as disrespectful, to the office of chief Kadhi urging him to apologize.
