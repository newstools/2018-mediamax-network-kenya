Five people including  a member of county assembly , three  bodyguards assigned to MPs and a mourner were shot  and injured  at the burial Likuyani MP Enock Kibunguchy’s driver in Kiminini, Trans Nzoia county.
Eye witnesses say, that  trouble started when Kakamega Sports CEC Robert Makhanu, arrived at the burial but was heckled away.
Ironically the leaders were attending the funeral service of Douglas Wakachi , who was felled  by a hitman’s bullet  last week .
