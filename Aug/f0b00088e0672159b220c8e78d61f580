Over 500 families in Sholinke village of Kajiado East sub-county can now enjoy clean water from a borehole dug by well-wishers after years of water scarcity. The borehole, the only one of its kind in the village was dug by Ong’ata Rongai Rotary Club in conjunction with american well-wishers under Well of Hope Foundation.
