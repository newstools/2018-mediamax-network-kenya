Holidays are over and it’s back to school. This, in the past, was a time for parents to breath a sigh of relief, particularly if their children were in boarding school. Going by the levels of discipline that were observed those days, parents were better assured that the youngsters were in a safe haven, at least away from a lot of ills that plague the youth. But, times have changed, and so has society. For one reason or another, it seems that these days students are inexplicably exposed to more distractions while away in school than when they are at home mingling with the public. We can only hope something, or many things, improve in our system sooner than later. We rounded up some useful stuff you may need to include in your back-to-school shopping this term in our Shop Smart section on page 16. When you’re done with the kids, you also need to shop for yourself, no? Sorry ladies, this time we had to do it for the gents, but, patience is a virtue, we’ll be having something unique for you soon. So men, there are some style ideas on page 14, and while at it, be sure to check out what non-verbal signals the state of your beard sends. Turns out it says volumes about your personality. Enjoy the rest of our sections, this week we’re back with all our regular pieces. Nice weekend!
