Barcelona star Ousmane Dembele has been pictured in London with four Arsenal players – and the club’s supporters have lost their minds with excitement he could be joining them. France winger Dembele has been linked with a shock move to the Emirates just a week before the transfer window closes in the Premier League. It has been claimed Arsenal were considering stumping up £75million to take the ace to North London – even though the club have suggested they do not have a huge transfer budget this summer. So when a photo emerged of the 21-year-old joining a quartet of Gunners players at a house party in London, it sent the club’s fans into a spin hoping a deal was close to being done. Dembele is a close friend of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from their time playing together at Borussia Dortmund. And he joined his ex-Bundesliga team-mate at a party celebrating the birthday of Aubameyang’s father Pierre. Also at the bash were Arsenal team-mates Alexandre Lacazette, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and new signing Matteo Guendouzi. The sight of the Barca star, who is yet to report back for pre-season training after winning the World Cup last month, with so many Gunners stars has convinced some a transfer is inching closer.
