John Terry and his wife Toni have been pictured on the back of a three-wheeled motorbike as they continue to make the most of their family holiday in Portugal. The former Chelsea and England captain is currently spending some time in the sun with his wife and their two children, Georgie and Summer. It appeared the couple were having some time to themselves though as Toni posted a photo of the two of them on a bike with Terry in the driver’s seat. He was wearing just swim shorts while his bikini-clad wife added the caption: ‘Mr T taking me for a ride’. The couple seem to be enjoying their time abroad and even posed for a photo with Jamie Redknapp after the trio enjoyed lunch by the beach on Thursday. Terry is currently without a club after leaving Aston Villa earlier this summer, having missed out on promotion to the Premier League in the Championship play-off final. Reports suggest retirement could be imminent while Sky Sports also appear keen to sign him as a replacement for Thierry Henry, who left his punditry role to pursue a coaching career. Despite leaving Villa Park, Terry is keen to see his former club go one step further this season and called on the highly regarded Jack Grealish to stay put after speculation continues to link him with a move away. ‘And just to clarify I haven’t had any conversations with Chelsea regarding Jack,’ he wrote on social media. ‘We all know he is good enough to play in the Premier League but we all want to see him do that with @avfcofficial. ‘Come on boys good luck this season UTV.’
