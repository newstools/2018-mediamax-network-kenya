Let’s talk bad brilliant decisions! I’ve never been one for FOMO… eerrm… fear of missing out. In fact, I pride myself in the regard that not a lot fazes me. So, imagine my surprise when I found myself on Friday night at 10pm grabbing my suitcase and packing away in a huff as I impatiently waited for my next adventure. I guess there’s no escaping FOMO, not really. And as Leanne and I hailed a hired ride in the night heading to Mara, we couldn’t help but laugh at how silly and unconventional the whole thing was. Our driver, David, was the perfect sport. He didn’t pass any judgment, God bless his soul. He listened along to our ridiculous banter, and even gave his two cents once or twice. Why Mara and at such godforsaken hours? Two words, 11 letters: Turnup queens! Like I said, no one can escape FOMO. And as such, my tale leads you to another — 254’s one and only Vegas; Nakuru. Last weekend, Kenya’s entertainment crème lit up the Rift as all roads led to NaxVegas. Thousands thronged the Nakuru Athletics Club to get in on the action. As one party haven sparked the night, an unlikely figure was blazing his own flame in Times Square. Celebrated comedian Eric Omondi, in what can only be called ‘Omondi fashion’, hit the vibrant streets of New York City adorned in regalia fitting of a traditional medicine man. He bartered ‘blessings’ with aloe vera, something that left many New Yorkers unmoved to the surprise and pleasure of the locals. You can get all the deets and more on page six. It’s a sizzling issue as usual. Enjoy!
