The national land commission chair Muhammed Swazuri has yet again dismissed a senate report linking him to  the 1.5 billion shillings Ruaraka land scam terming  it baseless and inconsequential.
The statement coming only hours after the interior cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i claimed MPs trying to solicit favours from his ministry were behind his woes.
CS Matiang’i , Swazuri and principle secretary Belio Kipsang  have been indicted in the senate report which recommends  that they be held personally liable for the lose of Ksh 1.5 billion in the purchase of the land.
