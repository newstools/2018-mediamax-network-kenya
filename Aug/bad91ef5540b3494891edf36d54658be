Embu governor Martin Nyaga Wambora was today holding onto his office after the court of appeal  overturned a high court decision that nullified his august 8th 2017 election win.
The appellate court ruled that the high court had erred in law by nullifying Wambora’s election following a successful petition filed by former Embu senator Lenny Kivuti.
Grace Kuria reports on a day that also saw  the elections of Starehe MP Charles Njagua alias Jaguar and his Lang’ata counterpart MP Nixon Korir was also upheld by the court of appeal.
