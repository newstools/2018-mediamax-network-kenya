12 people are reported to have died last night in a grisly road accident after a 14 seater matatu they were travelling in collided head on with a lorry. The accident which occurred at Kimende along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway is claimed to have been caused by heavy fog, which in turn blurred vision.
