David Macharia Vincent Ng’etich, eighth at the national cross-country championships early this year, yesterday showed a class of his own when he easily won a 10km race in Nyahururu. Ngetich who has just resumed training after suffering an injury during the cross-country season won the race at Siron Village in Laikipia West sub-county, Laikipia County by clocking 30 minutes and 24.1 seconds. The race organised by a Korean Jang Young Ki to promote sports tourism in Laikipia, ran on a 5km loop earth road in the village. Wilfred Kimitei was second in 30:32.3 and Bernard Ng’eno third in 30:33.3. Pius Karanja, Samuel Ndung’u and Paul Kariuki followed in that order for fourth, fifth and sixth positions in 30:36.5, 30:40.2 and 30:45.3 respectively. Joan Chepkemoi who was sixth at this year’s Shanghai leg of the Diamond League won the 5km for women 17:01. Way behind was Beatrice Chepkemoi who clocked 17:17.3 for runners up position. Third was Nancy Jesang 17:18.4, Nelly Jepchumba (17:22.7), Pauline Wambui (17:28.3) and Esther Waweru (17:35.1) followed in that order.
