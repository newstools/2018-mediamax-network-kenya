Members of parliament have now demanded that St.Gabriel’s  school administration and the  police  be held responsible for the death of the 10 pupils who lost their in a night accident
The MPs says the administration knew very well there was a 6pm to 6am ban school travel but still undertook the movement
This as president Uhuru Kenyatta directed schools administrations not to risk the lives of student through night travel maintaining the ban stands.
