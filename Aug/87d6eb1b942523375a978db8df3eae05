A planned demonstration discrediting Nandi hills member of parliament Alfred Keter, turned ugly after Keter’s supporters confronted the protestors with a swarm of bees, forcing them to run for safety. The demonstrators had staged the anti Keter protest to demand an apology from the legislator, for comments he made against deputy president William Ruto in Siaya a few days ago.
