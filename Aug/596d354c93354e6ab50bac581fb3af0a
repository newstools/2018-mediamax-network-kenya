Kumasi, Sunday It was at his elite boarding school in West Africa that Kofi Annan — the man who would later become the world’s top diplomat — learnt one of his most important lessons. It was, he said later, “that suffering anywhere concerns people everywhere”. The idea seems to have inspired Annan throughout a life which saw him play a key role in the crises which have shaped the world, from the HIV/Aids pandemic, to the Iraq War and climate change. Kofi Atta Annan and his sister, Efua Atta, were born in the city of Kumasi in what was then Gold Coast in April 1938. The twins’ first names meant “born on a Friday” in Akan, while their shared middle name means “twin”. Below are the years that mark Annan life’s journey: 1938: Born in Kumasi, now Ghana’s second city. 1962: Starts working at the United Nations in Geneva, Switzerland 1965: Weds Titi Alakija.
