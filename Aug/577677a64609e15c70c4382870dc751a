According to the firm’s chief executive, Peter Mwangi (pictured) the firm’s restructuring programme gobbled more than Sh300 million between January and May.

This is minus other costs. Additionally, an increase in deferred tax expense in some of the subsidiaries increased expenses for the first half of 2018,” he added.
