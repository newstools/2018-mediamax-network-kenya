Construction at the the multi-billon shilling five star hotel,along Waiyaki Way in Nairobi has been halted just a day after 16 workers including 10 Chinese nationals were arrested and charged in court.
Sources privy to the operation have told K24 that part of the building is sitting on a road reserve while another section is said to be impeding the construction of a feeder road to Waiyaki way.
