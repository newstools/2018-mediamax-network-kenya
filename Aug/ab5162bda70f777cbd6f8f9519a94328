Embattled Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matiang’i is now blaming his woes on MPs bent on intimidating him to get favours from  his ministry.
Matiang’i who is now haunted by the  ghosts of the controversial  Ruaraka land was indicted in a report by the senate committee investigating the illegal accusation of the land, which recommended  that he be held personally liable.
