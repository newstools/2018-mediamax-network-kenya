Deputy president William Ruto is now calling on institutions investigating the contraband sugar scandal to move with speed and bring those culpable to book.
Speaking during a development tour of  the sugar growing zones in Kakamega and Bungoma counties, the deputy president said the government will ensure cane farmers are protected.
As Chemutai Goin now reports, the 2022  succession politics dominated the deputy president’s meetings which were attended by leaders from across the political divide.
