 Laikipia Governor Ndiritu Muriithi has made 44 appointments to seven county boards to boost service delivery. Muriithi has tapped talents from both the corporate and public sector in a bid to drive growth. New appointments come just days after the governor launched a programme seeking to attract local and foreign investment to county. Among the appointees is Centum managing director James Mworia who will head County Development Authority as the non-executive chairman and former East Africa Cables chief executive and now the chairman of Nyahururu-based Countryside Dairy George Mwangi who will chair the County Enterprise Fund.
