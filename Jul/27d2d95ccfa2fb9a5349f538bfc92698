Residents of Kichinjio area in the sprawling Kibera slum have been given a reprieve after the Kenya Urban Roads Authority granted them four more days to voluntarily vacate their structures to pave way for the construction of a link road. The decision was made even as a section of affected residents and landlords voluntarily demolished their structures to avoid confrontation once the construction begins.
