Pathologists were Monday carrying out post mortem and Dna sampling of families of victims of last week’s accident in Emali  in a bid to establish the identify of badly mutilated and fragmented bodies. Families will have to wait  longer as pathologists work to match the Dna samples and the bodies which were burnt beyond recognition.
