The 80 year old gangster grannie who was earlier this week gunned down alongside her 26 year old grandson following a botched kidnapping incident in Murang’a county was Friday laid to rest at her home amid  anxiety. The late Wambui Muturi Karanja was buried in an atmosphere of anxiety with pastors from the local Anglican church staying away from the burial ceremony.
