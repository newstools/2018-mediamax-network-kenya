Chief administrative secretary Rachel Shebesh has decried the underutilization of the women enterprise fund in Kisii county. Speaking while disbursing funds to women groups in the town, Shebesh observed that while women in other parts of the country were aggressively seeking the empowerment money, women in Kisii were not taking advantage of the fund.
