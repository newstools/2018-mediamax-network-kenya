The Catholic church has asked the government to extend the services being offered by the Cuban doctors to faith-based institutions in order to ensure equal access by all Kenyans.. According to the chairman of the commission for health Bishop Joseph Mbatia, more patients will benefit from the services if the Cuban doctors are allowed to serve in faith-based health facilities.
