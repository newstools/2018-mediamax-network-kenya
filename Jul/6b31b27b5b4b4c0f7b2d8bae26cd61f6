There was drama in Nairobi Wednesday morning after a group of people accompanied by armed policemen stormed and kicked out  attendants at public toilets seeking to take control of the business adding a new twist to the management of the facilities. The Nairobi County Government earlier this month issued a notice notifying private operators of public toilets of its intention to take over the management of the crucial services.
