A proposal by the Parents Association of Kenya recommending to have a common uniform for all secondary and primary students has been met with mixed reactions.
According to the Chairman of the association Nicholas Maiyo, primary school pupils will wear grey uniforms with those in secondary school putting on blue uniforms if the proposal is approved by stakeholders.
