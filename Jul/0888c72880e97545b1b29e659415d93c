This has left them languishing at the bottom of the 16-team table with only 15 points. Kayole had the chance to redeem themselves while playing against Umeme at their Calvary home ground but failed to rise to the occasion despite enjoying the support from their loud home fans Failure to capitalise on the numerous chances they created in the match which they could have easily won owing to their 1-0 win over the former in their reverse contest saw them get punished by with two goals which sealed their fate at the tail of the log. Meanwhile, Jericho All Stars who have a game at hand, ascended at the summit after a beating Zamalek FC 2-0 in a one-sided duel at Camp Toyoyo ground. This was the 11th win of the season for the James Nandwa-led side and the third in a row.
