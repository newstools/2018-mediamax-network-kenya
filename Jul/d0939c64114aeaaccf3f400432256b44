A  public primary school in Kasarani constituency in Nairobi is using gunny bags as desks , following an influx of  learners seeking to take advantage of the  free primary education program.
At least 112 pupils use gunny bags on a cold floor ,  despite the government having allocated over 120,000 shillings to the school for maintenance this year.
