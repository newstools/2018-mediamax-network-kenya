A staff audit at the Migori county government has revealed the existence of 859 ghost workers who have  been fleecing the county of 91 million shillings in undeserved salaries annually.
The revelations were made by governor Okoth Obado in the wake of complaints by governors that resources allocated to the devolved units were insufficient.
