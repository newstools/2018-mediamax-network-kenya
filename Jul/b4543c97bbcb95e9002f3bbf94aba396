There were heated exchanges at the ongoing probe into the May 9th Patel Dam tragedy in Solai after Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Junior accused Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui for allegedly protecting the owners of the dam. The senators were even more angered after the owner of the Patel Dam Perry Mansukh claimed he could not recall when the dam was lisenced nor its holding capacity.
