Verdura groceries an online grocery shop with a physical shop in Nairobi has opened its largest outlet in Ngong town as it strengthens its foothold on Kenya’s retail sector. With the branch size estimated at 3,500 square feet and worth about sh 7 million; the retailer is targeting the high number of residents of Ngong town, Karen and Kiserian among other fast growing areas. “Ngong is a cosmopolitan town and the demand of affordable and traceable groceries there is increasing since the population is high. Even residents from the neighboring towns come here to shop,” said Peter Wangai, the Chief Executive Officer. Verdura entered the Kenyan market early this year and they have been dealing with organic foods and vegetables directly to the consumer at their physical shop in Hurligham. According to Wangai Kenyans are embracing and flocking to buy groceries online and this might be one of the rare market where brick-and- mortar retailers are actually setting the pace. “Since e-commerce is not 100 per cent embraced by Kenyans we still have customers who come to our shop to collect their groceries physically but we ensure that all deliveries above sh 1000 are delivered for free within Nairobi”. One out of every four consumers browses for products and services according to a new survey by Global consumer research firm Nielsen. The Nielsen Consumer Confidence and Spending Intentions survey released earlier this year says that there is a huge gap in retail e-commerce space yet a quarter of Kenyans use social media to find out about fast moving consumer goods brands.
