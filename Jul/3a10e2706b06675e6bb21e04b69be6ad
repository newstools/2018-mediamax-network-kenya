The World Cup may not have gone to plan for Lionel Messi, but the Barcelona star is certainly enjoying his time off. Messi enjoyed a night out with his wife Antonella Roccuzzo and the couple seemed in good spirits. Daniella Semaan, the wife of Messi’s former Barcelona team-mate Cesc Fabregas, was also in attendance. Close friends since childhood, Messi and Roccuzzo married last year and have three sons, Thiago, Mateo and Ciro. Despite Messi’s best efforts, Argentina were knocked out of the World Cup at the last-16 stage as they suffered a 4-3 defeat against France. Given that Messi will be 35 by the time the next tournament takes place, it is questionable whether he will ever win the World Cup. At club level, however, there is much for Messi to look forward to and Barcelona’s hopes of retaining the La Liga title will undoubtedly have been boosted by Cristiano Ronaldo’s move from Real Madrid to Juventus.
