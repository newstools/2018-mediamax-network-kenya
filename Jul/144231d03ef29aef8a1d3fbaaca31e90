Pupils of Josnah Primary school in Nairobi’s Ruai area were putting to test their future character as democrats when they went to the polls to pick their new leaders. In a bid to nurture their leadership qualities, the school held elections for a children’s government complete with the cabinet secretaries, senators, governors, deputy president and a president in a civic education exercise supervised by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission-IEBC.
