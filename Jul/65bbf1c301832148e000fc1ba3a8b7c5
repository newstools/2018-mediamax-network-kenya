Police in Kakamega have 10 students, a teacher and three  guards on suspicion of being behind the fire that gutted down a dormitory at Mukumu boys high school on Wednesday night.
The action came as it emerged that the ministry of education has called for a crisis meeting with the teachers service commission and teachers unions on Wednesday week to deliberate on how best to curb the rising wave of school unrest.
