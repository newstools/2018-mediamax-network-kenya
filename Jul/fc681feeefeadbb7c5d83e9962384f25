Voters in Lamu county could be headed for a repeat senatorial election after the court of appeal in Mombasa overturned a high court ruling that upheld the election of Anwar Loitiptip.
This as the court of appeal sitting in Eldoret reinstated Marakwet East Mp Kangogo Bowen and Turkana women representative Joyce Emanikor whose election victories last year had been annulled.
