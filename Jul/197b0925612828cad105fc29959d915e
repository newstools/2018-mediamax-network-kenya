The court will this and next week deliver its verdict on election petitions of governors Cyprian Awiti (Homa Bay), Okoth Obado (Migori), John Nyagarama (Nyamira) and James Ongwae (Kisii). Awiti will be the first to know whether he will retain his seat on Thursday when the Court of  Appeal rules on the petition he filed against lower court verdict that annulled his win and ordered a fresh poll. The victories of  Obado, Nyagarama and Ongwae were upheld by the High Court but the decision was challenged by their rivals who filed appeals. Both Ongwae and Nyagarama will know their fate on July 26.
