Residents living along the Pokot-Marakwet border are now demanding urgent action from the country’s security agencies following increasing incidents of bandit attacks along the border. This coming only two days after cattle rustlers raided a village in the region  living one dead and scores injured. This being the second attack in a span of one month with  more than 80 cows stolen.
