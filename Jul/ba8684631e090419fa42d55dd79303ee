Calls by the Kenya National Union of teachers for a national strike have run into headwinds after a section of teachers expressed their opposition to the move. Murang’a South KNUT branch has asked KNUT secretary general Wilson Sossion to first unite the national office before calling for a strike. Last week Sossion threatened to call for a nationwide teachers strike if the teachers service commission- TSC does not rescind its decision to implement alleged draconian  policies.
