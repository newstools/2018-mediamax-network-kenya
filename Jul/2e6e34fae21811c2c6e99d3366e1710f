The Kenya Wildlife Service Thursday morning paraded all the 18 horns belonging to nine rhinos  which died at the Tsavo East National Park days after they had been translocated from the Nairobi and Nakuru National Parks. The horns complete with the tracking devices that had inserted to monitor their movements were displayed  as investigations continue to unravel the exact cause of their deaths.
