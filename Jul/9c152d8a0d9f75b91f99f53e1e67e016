The Communications Authority of Kenya has issued a warning over the resurgence of a new  sim  card swapping scheme being used by fraudsters to swindle unsuspecting mobile subscribers. The alert was issued in the wake of a flurry of complains by mobile subscribers who had unsuspectingly been lured into swapping their sim cards leading to heavy losses.
