Operators of public toilets in Nairobi  have cried foul over alleged plans by the county government to over their business after they were issued with a vacation notice last week. The notice which was to take effect  last Sunday is yet to be effected after the private operators refused to heed the orders fearing their businesses will be taken by senior government officials.
