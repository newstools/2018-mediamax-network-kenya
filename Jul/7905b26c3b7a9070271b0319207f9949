Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko Saturday supervised the demolition of a wall  in South C estate to pave way for the expansion of an access road. Speaking  during the exercise ,the governor said the move will ensure that residents of Nairobi get  better services. The exercise comes following a directive by the  governor on the demolition of all illegal structures erected along sewer lines and public land that obstruct the implementation of the county projects. This comes after sewer lines in Nairobi’s Kariobangi  estate burst due to a blockage, spilling raw sewage in the area.
