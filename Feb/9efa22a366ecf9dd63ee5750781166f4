Chief Justice David Maraga and his Deputy Philemona Mwilu are on the spot after a petition by Lawyer Adrian Njenga sought their removal and five other members of the Judicial Service Commission citing serious violation of the constitution and the law, incompetence and gross misconduct. This is the second petition challenging Maraga and Mwilu’s suitability at the judicial helm. The fate of the seven now lies in the National Assembly which if satisfied by the petition will make a recommendation to the president who will then appoint a tribunal to interrogate the grounds for their removal. K24’s Apollo Kamau reports on the latest onslaught in what is turning out to be a sustained campaign targeting the judiciary.
