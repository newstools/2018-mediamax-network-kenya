DPPS @PeopleDailyKe The Government will establish a corridor along the Galana-Kulalu irrigation project in Tana River County to allow the residents access-watering points for their livestock, Deputy President William Ruto yesterday said. Ruto said following the establishment of the irrigation project, residents in the county have had problems in accessing watering points for their livestock. The Government, he added, values peaceful coexistence among communities in the region and was committed to addressing issues that threaten their harmonious relations. Addressing leaders from Tana River and officials from the ministries of Environment and Forestry, Wildlife, Lands, Agriculture and Devolution in his Harambee Annex office in Nairobi, Ruto said the solution was being sought over human-animal conflicts in the county over watering points. “We want to create a corridor for them to access watering points for their livestock,” said Ruto. Ruto said 250,000 acres of the 1.75million acres would be carved to establish the corridor for the watering points. He said a demarcation exercise will be carried out in the area to enable the residents make use of the areas earmarked for them without necessarily encroaching on the parts meant for irrigation activities. “The Lands Ministry should now embark on a survey work to pave way for demarcation to create a boundary between the irrigation and the watering points,” said Ruto. Present were Cabinet Secretaries Mwangi Kiunjuri (Agriculture), Keriako Tobiko (Environment) and Farida Karoney (Lands). Others were MPs Ali Wario (Bura), Juma Wario (Tana River) and Rehema Hassan (Women Rep)
