A murder suspect yesterday confessed before the High Court that she stabbed her boyfriend 22 times with a kitchen knife in 2015 at their house in Buru Buru estate. Ruth Wanjiku, who won the Miss Lang’ata prison beauty pageant in 2016, while giving her defence evidence before trial judge, Justice Jessie Lessit, admitted to court that on the morning of September 20, 2015, she stabbed her boyfriend several times in self-defence and in order to block Farid Mohammed from attempting to kill her after she discovered that he was HIV positive. She said she stabbed the deceased following a quarrel over a small yellow card from Aids Control programme showing he is a patient which she retrieved from his bedroom. Wanjiku said Farid became angry and snatched the yellow card from her before she was attacked from behind as she tried to pack her clothes in the bedroom and leave his house after discovering his status. “Farid told me that he would rather kill me and himself than his status to be exposed by me. I stabbed him several times using a kitchen knife which fell on my chest from the deceased hands after overpowering him by putting my two thumb fingers into his eyes to save my life,” said Wanjiku.
