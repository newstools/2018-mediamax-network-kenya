Speaking in Mwingi West Kitui county, the county commissioner condemned the act on police officer, insisting that charcoal burning and sand harvesting in the region was banned, until proper legislation is put in place. However, Nguutani member of county assembly Stephen Katana, said the recent demonstrations in Limuru will not hinder them from enforcing the sand and charcoal ban in the region. Christopher Nzili who is the chair of Nguutani professionals said the residents should protect the scarse resources and called on the government to give direction on how to curb the menace.
