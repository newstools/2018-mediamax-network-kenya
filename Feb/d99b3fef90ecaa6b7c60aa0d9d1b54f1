 After weeks of pull and push, the National Assembly finally voted in a new commission to look for their welfare. Members from the two divides unanimously voted in the new Parliamentary Service Commission members, which will be made up of Senator Beth Mugo, Aaron Cheruiyot, Adan Keynan, Naomi Shaban, Aisha Jumwa, George Khaniri and Ben Momanyi. Homa Bay Women’s MP Gladys Wanga, who has been lobbying to retain her position in the commission, suffered a major blow after her ODM party dropped her in favour of Khaniri. Debate on the motion was, however, interrupted by an interjection by Rarieda MP Otiendo Amollo who sought an interpretation of the law over whether MPs who had served in the commission previously were legible for re-election. Amollo wanted Speaker Justin Muturi to rule whether Keynan and Mugo were rightfully nominated for re-election. “My concern is that by re-electing those who served in the outgoing commission will be a violation of the Constitution which in Article 250 explains that one can only serve for one term of five years,” said Amollo. But in response, Muturi told the MP that the PSC cannot be compared to other commissions, saying there were exceptions. “The Judicial Service Commission has 11 commissioners, while the same law demands that the number not to exceed nine,” Muturi explained. The Speaker said whereas MPs are elected to serve for a term of five years, the same law calls for them to serve for a term of six years in the commission. Leader of Minority John Mbadi also supported the Speaker’s assertion, saying PSC is not guided by the sections Amollo had quoted. He said, the law had a number of ambiguities in that it bars individuals serving in independent commissions from any form of employment but was silent on the PSC commissioners who must be MPs.
