Meru Governor Kiraitu Murungi yesterday officially launched the Meru Economic and Social Council (MESC) to spearhead the county’s socio-economic development. Kiraitu (pictured) said the council will be a high level think tank and an advisory body comprising distinguished academicians, professionals and entrepreneurs. He said the council will give priority to development activities in all parts of the region in a bid to eradicate poverty and the unnecessary sub-clan divisions by addressing the question of equity in development. Speaking in Meru town during the launch, Kiraitu said the council will also promote unity and peaceful co-existence in the county because of its unique composition. “The initiative which we have already adapted is a brain child of retired President Kibaki that established the National Economic and Social Council to generate ideas for Vision 2030. I urge all the stakeholders in the area to fully support the think tank in order to make Meru great,” he said. The governor said MPs and county executives have been absorbed into the council.
