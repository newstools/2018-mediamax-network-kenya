James Momanyi @jamomanyi Kenya’s economy is expected to bounce back this year after easing of political tensions experienced last year during protracted electioneering, albeit at a slower pace compared to the neighbouring East African countries. According to the latest research commissioned by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) and produced by partner and forecaster Oxford Economics, the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth is projected to increase to 5.7 per cent during the first quarter of 2018. The report, the Economic Insight: Africa Q1 2018, which was launched yesterday, posits that the easing of political tensions within the country as the biggest factor that will contribute to this growth. Because of political stability, Kenya’s GDP growth projection is expected to rise to 5.7 per cent, an improvement from the previous quarter’s 4.6 per cent growth projection, a period that was punctuated with political campaigns and biting drought. However, despite the improved projections, Kenya’s growth is still moving at a slower pace than regional competitors Tanzania, Ethiopia, and Uganda. “The period of political uncertainty that plagued Kenya’s economy is gradually fading and this bodes well for the country’s economic prospects. However, Kenya still has some distance to go before it matches the growth seen in other EAC nations,” said Michael Armstrong, Regional Director of ICAEW Middle East, Africa and South Asia. The report says that Tanzania and Ethiopia are expected to remain as two of Africa’s fastest growing economies with their growth reaching 6.9 per cent and 7.5 per cent respectively. In Uganda, the report cites a marked recovery in the agricultural sector as the largest contributing factor to its growth from a lowly 2.5 per cent in 2016, to an estimated 6.3 per cent last year and a strong six per cent this year.
