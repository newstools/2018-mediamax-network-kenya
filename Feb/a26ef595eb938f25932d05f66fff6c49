David Macharia @PeopleDailyKe Nursery school children in Nyandarua will henceforth  be enjoying free milk courtesy of the county government. Governor Francis Kimemia, who launched the programme at Kagondo Primary School in Ndaragwa on Friday, said the initiative seeks to improve health and boost pupils retention Early Childhood Development Education centres. At least 23,000 children will benefit from the milk initiative three days a week. The governor said the initiative will also partly address stunted growth rate in the county which stands at 23 per cent. “Currently, the programme is fully funded by the county government but soon we will partner with the national government, private entities and other partners to sustain and expand it,” said Kimemia. He said single sourcing of the milk from KCC was due to urgency and will be on temporary basis until the county advertises for suppliers. Last October, the County Assembly passed a motion to implement feeding programme in pre-schools.
