Royal Shrovetide Football:  Where is it played: Ashbourne, England There is only one rule, no murder. This game has been played since the 12th Century. Twice every year, at 2pm, a football is thrown into a mob consisting of two teams, The Up’Ards and Down’Ards. There is a goal post which is nothing but a big wall on either side of Ashbourne, separated by a three-mile distance. There is no official playing area, as the entire town is included within the three mile radius. There is no limit on the number of participants and even tourists can participate. The game is usually played from 2pm till 10 pm. The ball is a specially designed ball which does not break and floats in water. The game ends when a player bangs the ball three times on the wall.
