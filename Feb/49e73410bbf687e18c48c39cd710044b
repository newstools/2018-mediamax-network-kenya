Morgan Heritage is one of the most recognised reggae groups in the world, more so in Kenya. Late last year, it was rumoured that the band were to relocate to Naivasha with their families. And while not much has been heard on the move since, word reached PD Wikendi that the celebrated band is set to shoot their next music video in Kenya. KOT were amazed once their business development manager, Patrick Sampao, broke the news on Twitter. “This is part of their efforts to display different parts of Kenya and also to make people know how Kenya is a beautiful country.” The Jamaican acts are set to jet in to the country early March, with the shoot taking place in Mombasa.
