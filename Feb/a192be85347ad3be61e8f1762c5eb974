Promotion favourites Kenya Commercial Bank (KCB) and Ushuru renew rivalry on Sunday at Camp Toyoyo as the National Super League enters Round Three. The pair has had great matches between them in recent seasons and this clash is expected to be the highlight seeing as they are Premiership contenders. Only a point separates them after two matches and both have had inconsistencies so far. The taxmen under coach Ken Kenyatta, has four points and last weekend drew 1-1 against stubborn Western Stima away in Kisumu. As for the bankers who are 10th in the log with three points, this is by far the biggest test yet for new tactician John Kamau. In the past two seasons, Ushuru lead the statistics by 2-1 and should prove a hard nut to crack for KCB. It does not help matters that 12th placed Modern Coast last week inflicted a painful 1-0 defeat to the bankers at Mbaraki. Unheralded league leaders Isibania have a huge task on Sunday against Western Stima at their home turf of Awendo Stadium. The border team under Dan Musta is the only side in the NSL, which has garnered full points thus far having beaten Administration Police and Nakuru Allstars in subsequent matches. An interesting duel is anticipated at Mbaraki Stadium today when siblings Coast Stima and Nairobi Stima clash. The powermen derby will see Ibrahim Shikanda’s regular contenders face the home side in a fixture of importance to both sides due to pride. The Coastal-based outfit are still bubbling after their 2-1 win over fellow newcomers last weekend. Nairobi Stima, which carries some of the league’s experienced squad on their part, drew 0-0 with Green Commandoes at Karuturi to remain third on the log. Elsewhere it remains to be seen if Muhoroni Youth will honour their fixture against Nairobi City Stars on Sunday. The sugar based side have absconded two fixtures on the trot and risk being expelled from the Championship altogether.
