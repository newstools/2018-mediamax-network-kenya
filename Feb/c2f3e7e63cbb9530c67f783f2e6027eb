National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) will roll out the smart driving licences in April after the piloting plan is complete. The new licences will be fitted with an electronic chip, which will bear a driver’s information including the name, blood type, biometric information and details of any offences committed. NTSA legal officer Judy Opiri said the chip will also hold information on movement offences submitted by the proprietor. She spoke on Friday during the launch of a report by the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (ODPP) on arraignments, adequacy and agency of prosecuting offenses. The chip-empowered licenses will consider the driver’s profile and give data on their qualification. NTSA is also working with the ODPP to introduce the Demerit Point System (DPS) where points are deducted from the driver’s card after committing a traffic offense. “If you commit any offence, police officers will swipe your card and deduct points from it,” she said. Each card will have 100 points and if the driver reaches 40 points, the card will automatically cancel the licence. The driver can only reapply after six months, a regulation that amounts to suspension. After three years, holders will reapply for new permits. NTSA said the government has already directed that any driver arrested for speeding should be  suspended for 30 days. Opiri revealed that NTSA is auditing the movement laws to address deficiencies relating to indicting activity offenses and modalities of on-the-spot fines for negligible offenses. The move, according to ODPP,  is aimed at decongesting remand prisons which are, on many occasions, filled with “petty” traffic offenders.
