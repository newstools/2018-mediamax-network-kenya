London, Wednesday @PeopleSports11 Arsenal will be convinced they have one foot in the next stage of the UEFA Europa League, as they entertain Ostersund in the second leg of the round of 32 on Thursday. The Gunners swept to a 3-0 victory in the first leg at the Jamtkraft Arena in Sweden, allowing the Emirates Stadium side room to breathe ahead of the next encounter. Arsenal vs Ostersund The Premier League giants were unfazed during their travels to Scandinavia, as a strike from Nacho Monreal, an own goal from Sotirios Papagiannopoulos and clever finish from Mesut Ozil sealed the win. Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger got just what he wanted in the first leg, and the veteran coach can now rotate his options safe in the knowledge progression is all but assured. The Swedish outfit displayed brief glimmers of quality as they hosted the Gunners, but there was a considerable gulf between the two teams. Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang remains cup-tied for the competition after former club Borussia Dortmund slipped from the UEFA Champions League into the Europa, but he will not be missed after a convincing 3-0 victory at Ostersund. Danny Welbeck played as a striker in the first leg, and the England international could feature again, with Alexandre Lacazette injured. RB Leipzig vs Napoli It’s advantage RB Leipzig for the second leg after running out shock 3-1 winners in Naples last Thursday. The Germany outfit are at a disadvantage as they played on Monday night compared to Napoli, who turned out on Sunday. Leipzig’s home form has produced some mixed results this season but they are favourites to advance to the next round of the competition as it’s clear Napoli are focusing on winning Serie A for the first time since 1990. -AGENCIES
