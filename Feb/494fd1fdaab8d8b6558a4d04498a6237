The country’s football giants Gor Mahia and AFC Leopards seem to have had invaluable exposure in their continental matches after both teams resumed the Kenyan Premier League (KPL) with identical 2-1 victories over their respective opponents. After being eliminated by FOSA Juniors of Madagascar in the Confederation of African Football (CAF) Cup which left their fans a disappointed lot, Leopards managed to grind a 2-1 win over Ulinzi Stars in a contest of two halves. But certainly, Ingwe will need to strive to conjure up more wins to haul themselves from the off tenth placing in the chart. As for Gor who saw off Vegeteranios of Equatorial Guinea to advance to the first round of the Africa Champions League, they beat Kariobangi Sharks to bridge a gap of one point with early leaders Mathare United. Mathare did themselves a big favour by condemning Sofapaka to their second defeat of the season by pelting them 3-1 at Kenyatta Stadium in Machakos. The loss by Sofapaka was least expected given that they had beaten battle-hardened Kakamega Homeboyz in their last match going into the weekend action. And after leaving their fans crestfallen over a spate of poor results, former champions Tusker woke up from their slumber by defeating Nzoia Sugar 2-1 in Ruaraka, a result which gave coach Sam Timbe and his charges confidence moving forward. “I am happy with the performance and I must congratulate the players for a job well done. What I demand from my players is consistency and I hope they can carry on with that performance in the upcoming matches,” said Timbe. Nzoia handler Bernard Mwalala while expressing satisfaction with the general performance of his team said he used greenhorns most of who could not cope with Tusker’s pace.
