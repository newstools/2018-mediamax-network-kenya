Fred Aminga @faminga Kenya is among countries banking on reforms to expand sustainable lending to drive development. Global Progress Report on Sustainable Banking Network under the aegis of the International Finance Corporation (IFC)q2 ranks Kenya among 34 countries that account for $42.5 trillion (Sh4,400 trillion) in bank assets—more than 85 per cent of total bank assets in emerging markets. The report outlines several good practices introduced in Kenya endorsing sustainable finance initiatives by the Kenya Bankers Association and the Central Bank of Kenya which includes environmental and social aspects and governance. Another good practice was the introduction of a dedicated website and an e-learning platform to raise awareness about sustainable banking practices, which has been used to train 80 per cent of bank employees. While some countries are very wealthy compared to others, the report notes that all countries made progress in advancing sustainable finance. Eight countries—Bangladesh, Brazil, China, Colombia, Indonesia, Mongolia, Nigeria, and Vietnam—have reached an advanced stage, having implemented large-scale reforms and put in place systems for results measurement. Kenya is currently developing a comprehensive sustainable finance initiative covering the entire financial sector. “The Sustainable Banking Network has demonstrated in a short time how much can be achieved when regulators, policymakers, trade associations and development institutions collaborate to advance sustainable finance,” said Ethiopis Tafara, IFC’s Vice President for Legal, Compliance Risk and Sustainability.
