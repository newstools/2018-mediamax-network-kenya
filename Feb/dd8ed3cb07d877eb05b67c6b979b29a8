A task force report presented to the Ministry of Environment Friday has blamed the destruction of water catchment areas in the country, for the increasing water crisis facing the country. The report compiled by the Kenya Water Towers Agency warns that Kenya faces the risk of being turned into a desert if increased human activity across all water catchment is not checked.
