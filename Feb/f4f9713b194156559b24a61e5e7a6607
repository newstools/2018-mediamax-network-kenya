The ruling  Jubilee party has today distanced itself from a constitutional amendment bill fronted by Tiaty member of parliament William Kamket which proposes the creation of the position of an executive prime minister, and clips the powers of the president while scrapping the position of deputy president.
Leader of majority in the national assembly Aden Duale says the bill has nothing to do with the Jubilee party saying they were yet to meet and discuss its proposals.
Kamket  who is a close ally of Baringo senator Gideon Moi has however dismissed Duale’s assertion and urged  MPs from across the political divide to support his bill.
