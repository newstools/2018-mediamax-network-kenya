Now following an earlier move by the Isiolo county government to send parking several Kenya Wildlife rangers over allegations of negligence, a lobby group has come out, drumming up support for the dismissal from work saying it was in the best interest of tourism in Isiolo. The group of youth now want the Isiolo county government to move with speed and replace all those rangers fired with qualified jobless youth  in the county.
