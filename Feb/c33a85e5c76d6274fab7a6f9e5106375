People Daily team, KNA @PeopleDailyKe Voters in Marakwet East constituency will have to elect another leader after the incumbent’s win was yesterdaydeclared null and void. The Eldoret High Court nullified Kangogo Bowen’s election. He had vied on a Jubilee ticket during last year’s polls. In a two-hour ruling made in the packed court, Justice George Kimondo argued that Kangogo’s victory, which was challenged by Sammy Kipkeu, a peasant farmer, was not free, fair, credible and verifiable and directed for a repeat election. Meanwhile, Garissa Township MP Aden Duale got a reprieve after Justice Hedwig Ongundi dismissed bribery claims by the petitioner, former National Assembly Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim. In her judgment, Justice Ong’udi said Duale was validly elected and claims by Maalim that some voters were denied a chance to cast their votes were not true. Elsewhere, it was reprieve for Governors James Ongwae (Kisii) and Okoth Obado (Migori) as different courts upheld their election. Also upheld was the election of Bonchari MP, John oroo Oyioka after an unsuccessful petition by former MP Zebedeo Opore. In the case of Ongwae, Justice Hellen Omondi said the petitioner failed to prove that Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and Returning Officer Robert Namulungu used an inauthentic voter’s register during the polls.
