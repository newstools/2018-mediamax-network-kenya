Vetting of individuals nominated for the Principal Secretary and ambassadorial positions has been completed and parliamentary committees now retreats to write their report. The teams are required to table reports with recommendations on the suitability of the nominees to Parliament for debate. The different parliamentary teams vetted 19 nominees. Defence and Foreign Affairs had the highest number of nine nominees with the last four for ambassadorial positions vetted yesterday. The four are former CSs Jacob Kaimenyi, Willy Bett and Dr Hassan Wario who have been appointed as envoys to Unesco (Paris), India and Austria respectively. Former State House Comptroller Lawrence Lenayapa who has been nominated as the envoy to Netherlands closed the vetting exercise. Image concerns Wario almost lost his cool when an MP asked for his reaction over shisha ban in the country. The MP alleged that Wario is an addict. “What I do with my private life is none of other people’s business. I have felt disrespected with that question,” Wario responded. Kaimenyi told the committee the two no-confidence-motions tabled against him ‘failed miserably’ because they were ill-intended. He dismissed notion that being nominated to an ambassadorial position was a demotion saying he is very excited to take the job. Asked whether he should retire by virtue of age and give other young people the chance to serve, Kaimenyi his 66 years is a plausible argument. “People in the University of Nairobi retire at 70 and 74 in other universities. I am not yet there. People older than me have done very well… Global trends are that no one should be discriminated on basis of age, Kaimenyi is very young,” Kaimenyi said.
