Kakamega county government will spend Sh100 million in this financial year to build a water reservoir. The project is meant to address water shortage in Kakamega town and its environs. County Environment and Water executive Robert Sumbi said construction of the 5,000 cubic litres storage facility will end water rationing, which he attributed to population. He said more funds had been allocated to improve the water infrastructure in Mumias town. Sumbi made the remarks during the launch of the Kakamega County Water and Sanitation Company (KACWASCO) strategic plan, which seeks to provide reliable statistics for improvement in water distribution. It is estimated that  61 per cent of residents have increased access to clean water. Increased budget Governor Wycliffe Oparanya, in a speech read for by Sumbi, said the county government had increased the budget allocation for water docket from Sh130 million last year to Sh300 million. He said the project was in line with the government’s goal of ensuring that 80 percent of residents had access to safe drinking water and sanitation facilities by 2022. “To meet the goal, there is need for strong institutional framework and sound financing mechanism, promising to revolutionise supply in rural areas by sinking boreholes to steady water supply from the main supply lines,” said the governor. Noting that access to safe drinking water has increased in the past four years, Oparanya pledged to rehabilitate Shitoli Water Project to take supply to Sigalagala-Bukura; Sabatia and Khwisero areas, and put up new project to serve Mumias-Mayoni and Matungu-Harambee. Treatment plant Water level has dropped in River Isiukhu following prolonged dry spell, disrupting supply to residential areas. Kakamega Water and Sewerage Company management said supply at the treatment plant had dropped from 15,000 cubic metres to 11,000 per day.
