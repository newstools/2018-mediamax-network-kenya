Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The woman accused of stealing a baby at Kenyatta National Hospital has been detained for five days at Kilimani Police Station for the police to conclude investigations Ednah Kerubo will be arraigned in court on Monday after Senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruiyot allowed an application by the police to lock her up. According to the police, preliminary investigations conducted revealed that Kerubo is involved in a wide syndicate of child stealing that lead investigations to Kisii where she was born and Bungoma county where she is married. In an affidavit by Emmanuel Kiptoo, a police officer attached at Directorate of Criminal Investigations, the court heard that the nature of the offence requires more time for investigating officers to complete investigations. “The investigating officers are still looking for other potential witnesses who were patients at the hospital on the February 18 and have since been discharged,” said Kiptoo in court documents. Police also state that they want to conduct a medical examination and a DNA sampling procedure to the recovered baby and the suspect. The court heard that more suspects are likely to be arrested as co-perpetrators of the offence of child stealing. Kerubo opposed the application pleading the court to grant her bail. She told Magistrate Cheruiyot that she is a first offender and had purposed to return the child. But the Magistrate declined saying the fact that she is believed to be part of a child stealing syndicate is a compelling reason not to grant her bail.
