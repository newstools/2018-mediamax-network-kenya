Chief Justice David Maraga and his Deputy Philomena Mwilu will be sleeping easy after National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi rejected a petition seeking to have them and six other members removed from the Judicial Service Commission. The speaker while dismissing the motion termed it a long shot pedestrian and a fishing expedition accusing the petitioner of seeking the removal of the seven JSC members in a manner not contemplated in the constitution. National Assembly Leader of Majority Aden Duale also disowned the petition saying it was not part of President Uhuru Kenyattaâ€™s pledge to revisit the judiciary.
