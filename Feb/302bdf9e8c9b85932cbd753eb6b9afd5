Try scoring sensation Collins Injera and teammate Billy Odhiambo have been recalled to the national rugby sevens Shujaa team heading to the HSBC world sevens series legs in Las Vegas and Vancouver. Head coach Innocent Simiyu made the announcement at the RFUEA Grounds yesterday, brining back the duo to the squad that missed out from Cape Town, Hamilton and Sydney legs due to knocks picked during the opening leg in Dubai. Simiyu believes the team has the key ingredients to post better results in Vegas and Vancouver owing to the return of the inspirational speed stars. “We have Fiji, Russia and France in our group, these are sides which we are familiar with and we have a strong team that should be able to see us through to the quarterfinals and beyond. The return of Injera and Billy is crucial for us as we seek to perform up to our target standards with a consistency for the entire 14 minutes,” said Simiyu. Missing from the squad is skipper Oscar Ayodi and Dennis Ombachi. The two are yet to fully recover from their injuries while Frank Wanyama failed to make the cut owing to his recent absentia due to school commitments. Commenting on whether they will be under pressure to keep up to their set standards, Simiyu remained firm that the team is ready to deliver above par results. “We always play well in Vegas and this year will be no different. We had a good pre-season preparation and that makes it easy for the team to perform and post good results. Our execution is what will matter most and I know we will be in for a big tournament,” he added. Assisted by Sammy Oliech, Oscar Ouma will don the armband in the absence of Ayodi who is expected to return during the sixth leg, Hong Kong Sevens slated for April 6-8.
