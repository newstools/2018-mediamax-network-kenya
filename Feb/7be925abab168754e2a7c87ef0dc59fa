Members of Parliament (MPs) yesterday opposed the push by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to have a cap on commercial banks interest rates abolished. An IMF team, which is currently in the country, led by Chief of Mission Ben Clements and IMF Resident Representative for Kenya Jan Mikkelsen told the National Assembly Budget and Appropriation Committee led by Kimani Ichung’wa that they have advised the government to abolish the cap on interest introduced in September 2016 as one way of releasing funds to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and the private sector. “The cap on interest was meant to address the high cost of credit. But what we have seen in the past one year since the introduction of the cap is a declining lending to the private sector and SMEs. The SMEs stock has decreased by 10 per cent in nominal terms. Lending to private sector has reduced to two per cent while the lending to government has increased about 25 per cent,” said Clements. “The concern was the high cost of credit but now there is no credit. That is why we are advising the government to abolish the caps or modify them to target specific sectors like agriculture or construction like in other countries instead of the general cap on interest,” he added. However, a number of MPs reiterated that the caps were introduced after commercial banks failed to regulate themselves, even after the intervention of Central Bank of Kenya (CBK), and continued to charge high interest rates ranging from 17 per cent to even 28 per cent. “Your data on the credit situation cannot be objective because it’s from the banking industry. We need data from an independent source because reduction of lending to SMEs is being used as blackmail from the industry to have the cap removed,” said Ichung’wa.
