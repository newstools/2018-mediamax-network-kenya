They say education is the best weapon to change the world, but unfortunately some schools across the country are unfairly disadvantaged with poor infrastructure and inadequate facilities seriously affecting their ambition to achieve this dream. One such school is Upendo Academy in Kwale county but although the private school is considered one of the best schools in Msambweni constituency, lack sufficient teachers and the absence of proper amenities have almost stagnated learning at the institution. The implementation of the new 2-6-6-3 curriculum appears to have worsened the situation with several schools across the country yet to receive the design of the new curriculum despite assurances from the Kenya Institute of Curriculum Development KICD. Our reporter Shukri Wachu was in Kwale county and gives us a glimpse of the state of education in the country under the new curriculum.
