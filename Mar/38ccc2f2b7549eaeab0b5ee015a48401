Lillian Mutavi @PeopleDailyKe The oversight role at the Nairobi county government might be downplayed following the move by the Opposition to work with Jubilee.This comes after some MCAs aligned to ODM supported Raila Odinga’s move to work with President Uhuru Kenyatta, following their surprise meeting on Friday, told those feeling aggrieved to quit. Last year, the County Assembly was on the receiving end when the Jubilee, which has majority of members, gagged the motion pushing for the “people assembly”. In a press conference at City Hall yesterday, Minority Leader Elias Okumu said members had unanimously decided to support Raila’s move. “We affirm our support for Raila as our party leader,”said Okumu. The ODM-aligned MCAs applauded the show of unity between Uhuru and Raila, adding that it was a symbol of statesmanship from the two leaders. When contacted, Majority Leader Abdi Guyo said the oversight role of MCAs is not be determined by the party they support, adding that he is confident that they will continue to perform their duties as required by law.
