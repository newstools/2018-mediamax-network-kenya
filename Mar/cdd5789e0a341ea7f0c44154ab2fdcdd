Residents of Kiambu county have been urged to support governor Ferdinand Waititu on the war on illicit brews in the region. Former Nairobi mayor Dick Waweru said that instead of fighting him, they should unite with the governor in eradicating second generation brews which have brought more harm than good in the county.
