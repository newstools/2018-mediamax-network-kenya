Kenya Forest Service Board Director Emilio Mugo has been suspended in a major shakeup of board entrusted with protecting the country’s now decimated forests. The changes come only hours after a disappointed Environment Cabinet Secretary Keriako Tobiko vowed to overhaul the board after touring some of the country’s forests and seeing the destruction for himself. Mugo will be replaced by career forester Monica Kalenda.
