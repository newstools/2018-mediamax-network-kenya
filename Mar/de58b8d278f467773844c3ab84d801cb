The war on illicit brews and drugs in Kiambu county received a new lease of life after area Governor, Ferdinand Waititu ordered the revocation of liquor licenses in the county to curb the sale of illegal brews. Former NACADA Chairman, John Mututho will now spearhead the war in eradicating the menace in Kiambu county after he was appointed a special liaison officer by the county government. The move came hours after the Kiambu county assembly passed into law the alcoholics and control of drinks act.
