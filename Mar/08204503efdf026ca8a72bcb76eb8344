National Treasury Cabinet secretary Henry Rotich has said his ministry is engaging stakeholders to formulate a proposal to lift or modify the cap on interest rates. The move is aimed at unlocking credit flow to the private sector, especially the SMEs currently facing a credit crunch. Rotich said the current cap on interest rates is not sustainable and noted that his ministry seeks to present the proposal before Parliament to accelerate change to the law. “It can entail an abolishment or a modification, or complete amendment to allow flexibility,” he said. There has been a sustained campaign by banks, the Central Bank of Kenya and development partners like the International Monetary Bank (IMF), to scrap or modify the caps. The caps were introduced in September 2016 when CBK set a floor for deposit rates at 70 per cent of the Central Bank rate and a ceiling for rates on loans around 4 per cent above, which currently stands at 10 per cent. Earlier this month, IMF said Kenya had committed to substantially modify interest rate caps.
