Njange Maina @NjangeWaEunice Information Cabinet secretary Joe Mucheru (pictured) yesterday unveiled a task force to formulate Information and Communication Technology (ICT) strategies to help steer the government’s ‘Big Four’ agenda. Move is expected to create jobs and spur Kenya’s manufacturing sector from nine to 15 per cent of the Gross Domestic Product. The 11 member team on Distributed Ledgers and Artificial Intelligence chaired by former permanent secretary Bitange Ndemo will recommend various technologies for use in solving Kenya’s intermediate problems. Mucheru says the team will among others things, review block chain and artificial intelligence technologies and prioritise their application in Kenya. Mucheru said the governments’ emphasis on affordable housing, universal healthcare, manufacturing and agribusiness will leverage on technology to create more jobs. “Reviewing the block chain technology and addition of human like instincts to computers will transform government delivery of services,” said Mucheru. He emphasised on the importance of a data base that will capture every citizen’s biodata to provide it upon request. Every Kenyan citizen will have a digital identity, he said. The taskforce will advise on computerisation of land titles issuing, election process and a transparent cash payment system. It will have three months to give its finding s and recommendations after which the CS will publish a gazette notice. Mucheru also announced the continuation of the Ajira Digital program that was launched with an aim of creating jobs through internet technology. The Ajira program was launched last year and trained literate youth on earning from the internet.
