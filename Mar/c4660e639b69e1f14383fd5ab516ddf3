Flamboyant businessman Jared Otieno has been charged afresh in a Nairobi court with obtaining $169,000 (Sh17.1 million) from two foreigners by false pretenses. Otieno, who became widely known after he bought a Porsche for Sh18 million, paid a bride price of Sh15 million and later held a lavish wedding in Nairobi in 2015 is jointly charged alongside businessman Sikanda Ismail Abdalla Saleh. They denied the fraud charges leveled against them by the state. On June 22,2017 when Otieno first appeared in court, he was charged with obtaining 17.1 million by falsely pretending that he was in a position to ship 50 kilogrammes of gold from Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Nairobi to Kuwait International Airport. But when the case came up for hearing before Milimani senior principal magistrate Martha Mutuku, the prosecution consolidated his case and that of Saleh who had earlier been charged. The magistrate released the accused on Sh3 million bond or a cash bail of Sh500,000. The case will be heard on May 18.
