Pupils and teachers of Kiboko Primary School in Thika West sub-county, staged a peaceful demonstration to protest alleged grabbing of part of the school land. They demonstrated inside the school compound waving twigs before uprooting beacons supposedly planted by the said grabbers last Friday. According to the school head teacher, Joseph Ndichu, he was called by one of his staff to alert him of unknown people who had contracted some youth to erect beacons to mark what seemed to be already subdivided plots of land. “I ordered them out of the compound and notified our education office and the area MP Engineer Patrick Wainaina who came to the school. They had already cleared the bushes probably to pave way for their mission,” said Muiruri. This was not the first attempt as some people had previously attempted to hive off the land from the school but parents stood their ground . He appealed for intervention from the National Land Commission, Lands and Education cabinet secretaries to rescue the school, which currently doesn’t have a title deed. Thika Kenta National Union of Teachers Executive Secretary, Joe Mungai Ngige termed the appetite for public land in Thika as very unfortunate, and warned investors in the region to be extra cautious when buying land as they are prone to be conned into buying non-existent or public land. “It is just the other day that they attempted to grab a children’s playground in Section nine, today it is Kiboko Primary School and I still understand that Umoja Primary is also sailing in the same boat. He appealed to the Ministries of Education, Lands and Treasury to expedite the process of school acquiring title deeds as this is only way to arrest the problem. Area MP through his Personal Assistant, John Mwangi Njuguna vowed to protect all public land in his jurisdiction, and promised to commence a project to fence all public schools in the constituency to protect them from grabbers and drug peddlers.
