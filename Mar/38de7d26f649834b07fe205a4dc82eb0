After finishing the 2017 Kenya National Rally Championship with a win in the season-closing KMSC Rally, Farhaaz Khan believes he has what it takes to master the conditions in the forthcoming African Rally Championship Safari Rally. Khan will be navigated by Keith Henrie in a Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution 10 and hopes to secure a top 10 finish in the event which counts towards the second round of the ARC and the Kenya National championship. Fazzy as he is fondly referred to as in racing circles, had a good outing on the season-opening Nakuru leg where he managed eighth overall and second in Group N which was satisfactory to the team. “We hope for a top finish in the Safari. Safari is the world’s toughest rally and a top 10 result would be respectful considering the overseas competition. Car preparations are getting better by the day and we can only hope for the best. My partner (Keith) has been spot on with navigation and given me the necessary cockpit support,” said Khan. “For this season, we are placed in the higher division and we’ll try our best at each rally and hope for respectable positions,” added Khan, who has words of praise to his Oilibya Racing sponsors who have been with them since 2015. “Together, we have grown and have risen every season to better positions and results. This year marks Oilibya’s 10 years of rallying in Kenya and they have been part of the sport since 2008 and they have backed champions such as Azar Anwar and Baldev Chager,” he said. He went on: “Keith and myself have grown together as a team and as we are getting faster and faster by event. We are trying to keep up with the rest of the pack and I must admit every rally is a learning curve for us.” “The modern technology has enabled us to achieve our career best results with this car (Evolution 10). However, I still miss driving the Subaru N10. This year we are in division one and we will try our best to remain in the Division come 2019. Last year, I finished the KNRC series in ninth.”
