Ngong Road derby featuring hosts Impala Saracens and Kenya Harlequins is undisputed the highlight clash in Saturday’s Kenya Cup knock out stage. The lone Nairobi inbound cup quarterfinal to be played at the Impala grounds will be the second meeting between the two this season with the Sarries showing little respect to Quins at their home turf on January 20, winning it 10-8. Rivalry renewal today will serve as the moment of truth, a contention upheld since time memorial known not to disappoint making today’s clash the weekend’s highlight as Kabras host Strathmore in Kakamega in the other fixture. Impala director of rugby Fred Ollows believes his side will emerge victorious at the end of 80 gruesome minutes despite Quins’ experienced line up. “Quins fancy their set pieces and are always competitive at breakdowns, largely around the border of the law. Their squad has experienced operators, the likes of (James) Kangethe, (Tony) Mutai, (Lyle) Asiligwa, (Isaac) Adimo, (Patrice) Agunda, (David) Ambunya, (Dennis) Muhanji and so on. They will also have good support from the replacements including Humwa, Okwomi, and Frank Wanyama, however, we will find a way to win it,” said Ollows. XThe winner of the clash will get the honours to travel across the city to Ruaraka next weekend for a semis clash against the defending champions KCB as the winner between Kabras/ Strathmore clash will travel to Jamhuri Grounds to take on Homeboyz. Sarries have tasked slippery Kenyan international Samson Onsomu the task to spot loose balls and supply the ball off set pieces and breakdowns in response to Quins breakdowns dexterity. Onsomu will be supported by Kenyan internationals Eric Kerre, Leo Seje, Ian Minjire and Samuel Motari. Quins on the other hand will be looking at dominating their set pieces supported by powerful running backs suggesting a fast-paced match.
