The government will not issue permits to commercial irrigators, landlords and industries that do not demonstrate water harvesting strategies. Water Resource Authority chief executive Mohammed Shurie said as part of condition for any entity dealing with water to be issued with a permit, it must prove strategies to harvest water that can last not less than 90 days. “All water users, especially commercial irrigators, landlords and industries, are encouraged to invest in water storage facilities that can last not less than 90 days. Note that this is one of the conditions before acquisition of a permit,” said Shurie. “We urge all citizens to ensure water harvesting is highly prioritised so that there is enough water for use even after lapse of rains. Equally, it will enhance water efficiency. Citizens should take advantage of the current rains by putting in place adequate water storage to collect water,” said Shurie. Speaking on the current status of water in the country at his office, Shurie said that five counties Isiolo, Kajiado, Mandera, Tana River and Garissa have been categorised as high drought stress and worsening. Last week, Devolution and Arid and Semi-Arid Areas (ASALs) Cabinet secretary Eugene Wamalwa said Government will use Sh350.9 million for water trucking, maintenance and fuel subsidies. Shurie regretted that despite the rains currently being experienced across the country, it is uncertain whether they will adequately stabilise the existing water bodies. Owing to the vagaries of climate Shurie explained that the environment has two extremes characterised by extreme drought and floods. “This is nature and we should be able to cope with the situation,” stated Shurie. The country, he said, is under water stress but should the current rains being experienced in parts of the country continue this could change the situation.
