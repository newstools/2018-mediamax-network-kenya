Kirera Mwiti @PeopleDailyKe The Ministry of Water requires Sh100 billion every year to meet the rising water demand in the country, Cabinet secretary Simon Chelugui has said. Speaking during the Kenya Water Summit launch in Naivasha yesterday, the CS said against the current Sh40 billion budget is inadequate, with many Kenyans lacking access to clean water. Chelugui (pictured) said access to water, however, has improved from 30 per cent to 60 per cent for the last three years. “It’s projected that if the current trend continues, then we shall achieve 80 per cent access by 2020 and universal access by 2030,” he said, adding that the ministry requires more funds to meet its targets. Several governors attended the event. Chelugui put no notice some water companies that borrowed loans from donor and failed to service them. He lauded Nyeri Water and Sanitation Company, which he said faithfully paid its loans. “These loans should be paid using the revenue collected,” said the CS. Vihiga Governor Wilber Ottichillo, who represented the Council of Governors, said water shortage and sanitation was still a challenge for many counties. “The emerging challenges include low funding, degradation of water towers, raw sewerage on our streets and prolonged drought, which have continued to affect water and sanitation services,” he said. Nakuru Governor Lee Kinyanjui lamented increased environment-related disputes across the country.
