Transport Cabinet secretary James Macharia is expected to appear before Parliament next week over the stalled Busia-Malaba road. Teso South MP Geoffrey Omuse said he tabled a motion in Parliament requesting the CS to explain why the project, which was launched by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto in December 2016, has stalled. Addressing the press in Busia town, Omuse said the project was to be completed in 18 months, but the contractor and engineer in charge disappeared from the site making the project stall. He said business will be enhanced between Busia and Malaba towns once the project is complete, adding that farmers will be able to transport their produce easily. “I urge Uhuru to intervene so that the project can be completed,” he said.
