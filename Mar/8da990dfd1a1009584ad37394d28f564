The contest will now be held in 25 counties with an aim of improving performance in mathematics. Teachers trained Brookside Marketing manager Peter Wesonga said this year’s contest also features a conference for mathematics teachers where they were trained by mathematicians from Maseno University on how to adopt modern ways of teaching the subject.
