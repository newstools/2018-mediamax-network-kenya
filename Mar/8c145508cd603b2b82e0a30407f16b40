Lynette Matheka @Peoplesports11 Kenyan clubs Pipeline and Prisons will face unfamiliar tests in their quest to clinch the elusive continental club title when this year’s Women’s African Club Championship serves off at Al Ahly club in Cairo, Egypt today. Reigning national league champions Pipeline are in group C that is headlined by 2017 silver medallists Shams of Egypt with FAP of Cameroon, DGSP of Congo and Vision of Uganda completing the set while Prisons, who finished third in the last edition, headline group D that has Injs of Cameroon, Douanes from Burkina Faso, Customs of Nigeria and Asec of Cote d’Ivoire. Japheth Munala’s Pipeline begin their title hunt against Shams today before meeting Uganda’s Vision on Thursday. They will take on DGSP and FAB on Friday and Saturday respectively. Skippered by middle blocker Triza Atuka (pictured), Pipeline are hoping to replicate their local good performance in Egypt as they search for an eighth continental title. “We started preparations early and the players are fit and upbeat for the competition we expect in Egypt. We have suffered a few injuries but thankfully, three of the four injured players recovered well in time for the championship,” said Atuka before leaving for Egypt. Meanwhile, David Lugh’aho’s Prisons will not be in action today as their campaign serves off tomorrow against Customs. They will then take on Asec on Thursday with clashes against Douanes and Injs scheduled for Friday and Saturday. Kenyan clubs have struggled to reclaim the continental silverware since 2013 when Prisons clinched it in Madagascar before the rise of North African clubs.
