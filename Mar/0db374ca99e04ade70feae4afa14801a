The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) yesterday unearthed a syndicate in which trucks ferrying petroleum goods to neighbouring countries have been dumping fuel on the Eldoret-Malaba highway. The move, they said, is losing Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) billions of shillings in taxes. The sleuths, who have been carrying out surveillance on the dumping of fuel made for export, impounded one tanker and arrested three people at Bukembe in Bungoma county. “We laid ambush and managed to impound a tanker which was offloading the petroleum goods at a yard in Bukembe. We arrested three people but others escaped including the driver,’’ said an officer who didn’t want to be named. He said the yard has been receiving about 10 tankers every week each loaded with 40,000 litres of petroleum goods dump there and cross over to Uganda only for formality purposes. The officers said KRA was losing more than Sh22 million weekly when dumping of fuel takes place in one yard. “We have almost five yards on the Eldoret-Malaba highway where dumping is taking place so in simple terms KRA is losing 110 million tax in one week,’’ he said. The officers said those involved in the unscrupulous business were working with KRA officers because they also impounded seals which they use to seal the empty truck. They wondered where the transporters get extra seals because after dumping the fuel they seal the empty trunks and then cross to Uganda. “We have also launched investigation into the KRA officers because why should a private individual come into possession of custom seals?’’ posed one of the EACC officers. He said they were also going to involve Kenya Bureau of Standard to find out if the dumped fuel had been tampered with.
