Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The High Court has quashed the order by the Treasury and the Kenya Revenue Authority to affix Excise Stamps through Excise Goods Management System (EGMS) on bottled water, non-alcoholic beverages and cosmetics. Justice John Mativo (pictured) ruled that the legal notice of March 2017 was enacted in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution and the statutory Instruments Act in that there was no adequate public participation prior to its enactment, hence null and void. And following the ruling, the National Assembly Public Investments Committee chaired by Mvita MP Abdulswammad Nassir has summoned KRA top brass to appear before it on March 20. KRA in a media notice had indicated that from November 1, all juice, bottled water, plastic bottled sodas, food supplements, energy drinks and cosmetics manufactures and importers will need to have the excise duty stickers on their products. The court, however, quashed the said order, noting that KRA did not conduct public participation yet the courts have often held that public participation is not a mere cosmetic venture or a public relations exercise. Justice Mativo ruled that the subsidiary legislation must conform to the constitution, the parent Act and the statutory Instruments Act in content and the manner in which it is adopted and failure to comply renders the legislation invalid.
