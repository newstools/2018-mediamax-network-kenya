Prices of coffee and tea have declined in a fortnight owing to low quality and decline in international prices. The price of the export commodities went down by 2.6 per cent and 13.3 per cent in last week’s auctions carried out at Mombasa and Nairobi respectively. Average price at the Nairobi Coffee Exchange (NCE) decreased to Sh22,393 ($221.12) per 50-kilogramme bag during the auction from Sh25, 846 ($255.21) recorded in the previous week, according to a market report from the bourse. NCE chief executive officer Daniel Mbithi said quality of coffee has been declining prompting the price drop, adding that most of coffee offered for sale at the NCE did not attain the reserve price. “The quality of coffee that we are now getting at the auction has gone down and this is what has affected the price,” he said. The coffee that is trading at the auction currently is coming in from the main crop season in central Kenya. The harvesting season starts in October with supplies running all the way to March. Last year the crop was hit by drought that affected most parts of the country leading to postponement of auctions at some point. Compared to global prices Kenya coffee still remain high owing to its pleasant aroma thus making it the highly sought beans by roasters to blend their coffees in the world. Prices at the New York Coffee Exchange last week stood at slightly over Sh12,000 ($121.45) while the International Coffee Organisation (ICO) composite price indicator reached Sh12, 819 ($126) for a 50 kilogramme bag. According to the market report out of 794 lots of clean coffee transacted at the NCE, only 100 lots of clean coffee were bought while the rest were only noted. Noted coffee refers to coffee beans which the dealer declines to buy even after quoting a certain price. The noted coffee is later offered for sale during the following sale day or the dealer reaches out to the farmer to agree on the quoted price to avoid offering it again for sale at the auction. “Out of the coffee offered for sale, only 10 per cent had its price confirmed while the rest was noted,” said Mbithi. Mbithi explained that the earliest a noted coffee can come to auction is in two weeks’ time. But, only if the farmer decline to accept the noted price. Maximum price in all grades during the auction declined to Sh39,592 ($392) from Sh55,550 ($550) attained in the last auction. Meanwhile at Mombasa tea auction, tea prices declined by 2.6 per cent to Sh268 ($2.66) compared to Sh275 ($2.73) registered during the first week of this month. Volume of tea offered during the last auction declined to 7.2 million kilos which is a drop of 367,721 kgs from 7.6 million kgs recorded during the March 5 to 6 auction period. Earnings during the last week’s auction dropped by Sh5 million from Sh620 million recorded during the auction of early this month. According to Economic Survey 2017, the unit price of exported tea declined by 11.6 per cent to Sh259 per Kilo in 2016, while the price of a Kilo of coffee remained at 2015 level of Sh472. Export earnings of coffee and tea in 2016 reached Sh145.8 billion, accounting about 30 per cent of the total foreign exchange earnings the country received in 2016. Tea returned Sh124.5 billion while coffee industry earned Sh21.3 billion.
