Anthony Mwangi and Murimi Mutiga @PeopleDailyKe National Super Allaince plans to petition the Parliament to stop the Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission (IEBC) from reviewing electoral boundaries until after the commission is reconstituted. It wants the commission to be disbanded and a new one put in place to oversee the review. Matungu MP Justus Makokha said he is ready to take the matter to Parliament to stop IEBC from carrying out the process. Some Nasa MPs said the current commission cannot be trusted to carry out the work going by their performance in last year’s General Election. However, IEBC chair Wafula Chebukati (above) said he has not received any official objection against electoral boundary review from Nasa. Chebukati, however, said IEBC was the only body mandated by the Constitution to undertake review of the electoral zones. “Every party is free to express views. We had two goals; to conduct 2017 elections, and reform IEBC to avoid future errors,’’ he said. Speaking at the side lines of the National Assembly post-elections seminar which ended yesterday in Mombasa, the opposition MPs said they will not accept any process carried out by the Chebukati team. “We have experienced what the commission incompetence can do. The commission must be reconstituted before it embarks on the boundaries review,” said Makokha. But Jubilee MPs said IEBC must be allowed to do its constitutional duty. Kimilili MP Didmus Baraza said Nasa had no tangible reasons to make fresh demands on the IEBC. “The Opposition should not be allowed to hold the country at ransom. How sure are we that they will not oppose a new commission if its formed?” he asked. On Tuesday, Nasa called for an overhaul of IEBC, saying it has no trust with the poll agency as currently constituted having “mismanaged” the August 8 presidential election.
