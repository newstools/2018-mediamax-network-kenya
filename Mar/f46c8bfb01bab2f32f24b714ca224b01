Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Six candidates for the post of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) were yesterday grilled in sessions that the media was momentarily barred. The first to be interviewed was former Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioner Thomas Letangule, Supreme Court Deputy Registrar Daniel ole Keiwua and Senior Assistant DPP James Mungai Warui. “The media and members of the public are not allowed in here,” A Public Service Commission (PSC) official said before the interviewing panel intervened . Warui amused the panel when he called for death sentence if the accused exhausts all appeal avenues. He also committed to ensure expeditious clearance of prosecution files to avoid backlog of cases. “I still believe that death sentence should be executed when accused exhausts all appeal avenues. I will ensure that no public prosecution case will sit on the DPP desk for more than three years,” Warui said. The interviewing panel chaired by Elizabeth Muli comprises seven members among them Kennedy Kihara (Office of the President), Maryann Njau (Attorney General’s office) and Youth Principal Secretary Lillian Omollo alongside four others. In the afternoon, National Intelligence Service senior director Noordin Haji, Senior Counsel Lucy Kambuni and Deputy DPP Dorcas Oduor were grilled.
