Anthony Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe The government has reinstated security detail withdrawn from Opposition Nasa-allied legislators. Among those whose security was restored are National Assembly Leader of Minority John Mbadi and the Minority Whip Junet Mohamed. It was not clear whether the government would reinstate passports of senior Nasa leaders. Junet and Mbadi confirmed their security had been reinstated. “Police officers attached to me called to inform me that they had been told to report to work,” said Junet, who welcomed the move. Mbadi said: “My driver called me this morning and told me he has been told to go and pick the vehicles. I am yet to contact my security though.” The development comes days after President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga pledged to work together to unite Kenyans. The government had withdrawn security detail of 141 opposition MPs over their involvement in Raila’s mock swearing-in as people’s president on January 30. Others affected include MPs Millie Odhiambo(Suba North,) Simba Arati (Dagoretti North) Gladys Wanga (Homa Bay Woman Representative), and Lilian Gogo (Rangwe). The Firearms Licensing Board also revoked the firearm licences of those perceived to be members of the National Resistance Movement.
