Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Police foiled a major terror attack targeting the Judiciary and government buildings last month, Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet said yesterday. He said the terror plot was planned by al Shabaab militants in Somalia with local facilitators in Nairobi, Isiolo and Rongai. But Boinnet said the attack was pre-empted after police intercepted a Nairobi-bound vehicle loaded with explosives at Merti, Isiolo. One suspect was killed and two others arrested in the operation. He said they believe the terrorists wanted to rescue detained terror suspects during a court sessions in a bid to embarrass the government. “Security agencies have been able to pre-empt many terrorist attacks in the last three years. A month ago, Isiolo security committee thwarted a terror plot in Merti that targeted Judiciary and government buildings in Nairobi,” said the police boss. Speaking at the Directorate of Criminal Investigations headquarters in Nairobi, Boinnet said two more suspects, profiled as facilitators, linked to the terror plot have been arrested. He was accompanied by DCI boss George Kinoti. Explosives recovered from the vehicle in Isiolo had the capacity to bring down buildings within a 250 metre radius. “Terrorism is a major threat to global security. For the last three years, joint efforts between the police and other security agencies have disrupted numerous potentially devastating terror plots targeting Kenya,” said Boinnet. The police boss was also categorical that the two Iranians nationals initially sentenced to life imprisonment for terror-related charges but later appealed and jailed for 15 years were still in police custody. “Who said they are not in the country? They are in custody,” he told journalists.
