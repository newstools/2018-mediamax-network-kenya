Kitutu Chache South MP Richard Onyonka has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to embrace other National Super Alliance (Nasa) co-principals in the unity pact he signed with the alliance’s leader, Raila Odinga. He said the inclusion of the principals—Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (Amani National Congress) and Moses Wetang’ula (Ford-K) would foster unity and hasten development in the country. Speaking at Marani Stadium on Saturday during the inauguration of St Patrick Marani Parish by Bishop Joseph Mairura, the lawmaker said he is tired of being in the Opposition saying that he wants to take part in the country’s social and economic development. Onyonka, accompanied by Governor James Ongwae, Deputy Governor Joash Maangi, Dagoretti North MP Simba Arati and area MCA Dennis Ombachi said he will not defend his parliamentary seat in 2022. Ongwae pledged to support the new parish priest Ignatius Angoi Nyamweya and construct roads in the area to help resident’s access institutions and markets.
