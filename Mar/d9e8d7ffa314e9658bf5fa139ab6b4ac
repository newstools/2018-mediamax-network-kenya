Environment  cabinet secretary Keriako Tobiko has vowed to overhaul the management of the Kenya forest services for  failing  to protect the country’s forests from wanton destruction.
Speaking after conducting an aerial tour of three forests in the expansive Ngong forest catchment, Keriako promised radical changes at the organization for failing to protect the country’s water towers.
He spoke as the Kenya water towers agency said it was in the process of gazetting 70 new catchment areas across the country as the government moves to protect the country’s  water sources.
