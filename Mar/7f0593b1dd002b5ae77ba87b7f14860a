Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Commercial banks have been advised to adopt a risk-based pricing approach in a bid to offer cheaper loans to less risky borrowers and avoid accumulating huge non-performing loans. Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Governor Patrick Njoroge (pictured) said commercial banks need to start offering cheaper loans based on a borrower’s risk assessment. Njoroge spoke yesterday, a day after the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) fixed the Central Bank Rate at 9.5 per cent from 10 per cent. Risk-based pricing is a methodology adopted by many lenders in the mortgage and financial services to measure loan risk in terms of interest rates and other fees. John Kirimi, director of Sterling Capital said interest rate on a loan is determined not only by the time value of money but also by the lender’s estimate of the probability that the borrower will default on the loan. He said a borrower who the lender thinks is less likely to default will be offered a better (lower) interest rate. “This means that different borrowers will pay different rates depending on their risk profile,” he said. Concerns have been raised about the extent to which risk-based pricing increases borrowing costs for the poor, who are generally more likely to default and thereby further increases their likelihood of default. Some supporters of risk-based pricing have argued that, at least in certain contexts, default prediction should be limited by ethical considerations and focus on factors that are under borrowers’ control. Njoroge said local commercial banks will henceforth be on the radar of Central Bank to see their reactions after it lowered the interest rates to 9.5 per cent to enable the private sector to access credit. According to CBK, lowering of the interest rates is meant to spur borrowing in the private sector, especially by the SMEs – which had been hard hit due to interest rates cap in a bid to boost economic growth and create jobs.
