by Gibo Zachary @PeopleSports11 After the final whistle in the wake of Cardinal Otunga’s last-minute penalty win over a hard-fighting Nyabigena Secondary School in the Kisii county games last weekend, it was a surreal moment as the winners erupted into wild celebrations. In what was a nerve-wrecking rugby 15s finals, Cardinal Otunga who were the county defending champions, were on the brink of elimination with a pensive school principal Dennis Munyendo contemplating leaving the pitch and wait for results from distance until David Marenoti’s kick did the trick. That was after Nyabigena had cancelled Cardinal Otunga’s early try scored by Edwin Yuvinalis and converted by Marenoti with a penalty from Amos Cornelius and unconverted try from Eugene Osoro giving the former an 8-7 lead until Marenoti’s sure kick sent them to the Lake Region games that begin next week at St Mary’s Yala in Siaya County. That character has now given Cardinal Otunga belief that a win at the regional is possible with a place in the national games at stake. “Whatever you need to prepare for the regional championship, you let me know and I will provide because you have showed great fighting spirit. I assure you of my unwavering support and if it’s food that you want increased, you will get it,” said an elated principal Munyendo amidst cheers from the team.
