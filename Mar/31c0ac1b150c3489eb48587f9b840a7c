254 was abuzz when news hit that socialite Vanessa Cheruto, popularly known as Chettle, deliverd a beautiful baby girl in a not so conventional way. Venessa broke the news that the delivery took place in a bathroom. While we thought that was all the drama we’d hear about this new mom, a video surfaced of Venessa with bottle of beer in hand. Scores were stunned as the beauty gave birth barely a fortnight back and was already hitting the party zone. Speaking to the trendin.ke team, Venessa, had this to say. “I had gone to network and indulged a bit. I was really bashed because of the video and some of my family members even arranged a sit down. I am, however, a full time mum and always indoors.” When asked about the safety of her child while she was away, the 22-year-old disclosed that her daughter was with the nanny and that “she is on formula.” Venessa also spoke on the baby daddy saying that he was not in their life, and thus couldn’t comment much about him.
