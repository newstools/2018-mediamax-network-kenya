The government has issued a one million shilling reward for anyone with information that will lead to the capture of Timothy Kiptanui Kitai alias Cheparkach believed to be the mastermind of the spate of killings and violent robberies in the volatile Mount Elgon region. The action came only a day after the government imposed a three month dusk to dawn curfew on the region following a spate of violent attacks that have seen several people killed while hundreds of others have fled their homes.
