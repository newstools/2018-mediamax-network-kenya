Business activities at the troubled retail chain Nakumatt Holding Ltd outlets in Mombasa were yesterday paralysed for the better part of the day after more than 50 employees staged protests over their sacking. The employees turned their wrath on Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) Secretary General Francis Atwoli whom they accused of being quiet as their rights were being violated. This is after employees drawn from Nakumat Nyali and Nakumat Cinemaxâ€™s different departments were issued with retrenchment letters by the management. The departments affected are security, shop assistants, procurement and administration. All of them were employed on permanent and pensionable basis. The employees said they have been struggling to feed their families for the last eight months. Sheila Mbaisi, an employee at the Cinemax outlet claimed she was notified of her retrenchment through a mobile short message (SMS) which also asked her to collect her letter from the management. Other employees the People Daily talked to claimed the management served them with letters of dismissal under grounds of insolvency.
