Barry Silah @obel_barry Nairobi will host to international cricket tournament that is set to impact the image of the sport in the country. A top-level 10-day T20 Legends Cup championship involving three franchises has been confirmed between July 19 and 29. According to the organisers Crickeley Management Ltd Kamal Patel, this event will be a boost to sports tourism and inspiring future stars in Kenya. “We anticipate that this project will bring back hope to cricket. It will be prudent that all stakeholders support it. It is a trying phase for cricket lovers in the country but we want to help in bringing good memories through this festival. We are already in talks with various partners like media and other corporate players in the country to make this project a huge success,” said Patel who leads the organising committee. The tournament is structured in such a way that it will have an Asian 11 team, Pacific 11 and World 11, which will carry some of the world’s greats. Countries that will have some of their legends play will include India, South Africa, England, Australia and Pakistan amongst others. Hosts Kenya will parade former national team stars including former captains Maurice Odumbe and ex all-rounder Steve Tikolo. Head consultant of the tournament Tom Tikolo while unveiling the structure revealed that plans are afoot to hold the licensing rights for the tournament for five years. “We are looking at a five-year plan so that it becomes more commercially viable. The tournament will be a game changer because it will be played under floodlights between 6pm-9pm and we anticipate anything between 2,000 to 3,000 people attending,” he said. Additionally the planners will work closely with key stakeholders like government and Cricket Kenya (CK) to ensure optimum results. Legendary Maurice Odumbe on his part expressed great feeling that such a tournament was coming at a time when the belief was low in the sport.
