Wangui Githugo @Wango_G US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson who has been in the country since Friday, yesterday resumed his normal schedule, away from the glare of the media, after canceling events on Saturday because he “was not feeling well.” Tillerson laid a wreath at the US Embassy yesterday morning at a ceremony to honour those killed and injured in a bombing at the site two decades ago. “As all of you well know, in 1998, terrorists thought they could demoralise and destroy the Kenyan and American people by attacking the US embassy here in Nairobi. Of course, they were wrong. Nearly 20 years later, we meet here to honour those who we lost and those who were injured,” he said. He also met Foreign Affairs Cabinet secretary Monica Juma where he held bilateral talks. According to the official Foreign Affairs Office twitter handle, where also photos of Kenyan officials present for the meeting are posted, the meeting lauded the cordial Kenya-US relations. The tweets said the meeting was centred on creating a joint framework for innovation and technology with a focus on youth and entrepreneurship, human capital development through greater inter-university collaboration, people-to-people exchanges for tourism, education and culture, regional security cooperation including African Union Mission to Somalia (Amisom). “Among issues agreed upon is to establish a framework for bi-annual consultations, discuss and sign a compact agreement for Kenya-US trade and investment especially on the Big Four and enhance security cooperation,” read the post. He was later to visit the Kenya Wildlife Service headquarters but journalists who had been invited to cover the event were turned away. His schedule for Saturday included a visit to a US-funded HIV/Aids programme (PEPFAR) and attendance at a ceremony marking 20 years since Al Qaeda bombed the US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killing 224 people.
