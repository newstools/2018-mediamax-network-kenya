The government and the opposition national super alliance were today moving to action some of the agreements reached during Friday’s meeting between  president Kenyatta and NASA leader Raila Odinga with the latter suspending the people’s assembly agenda.
In what appears to be implementation of the pact between the two leaders, NASA steering committee chairman David Ndii said the decision was reached following a request by president Kenyatta and Mr. Odinga.
The suspension of the peoples assembly happened as the government restored the security detail of opposition leaders.
