Petroleum and Mining Cabinet secterary John Munyes said yesterday Kenya Pipeline Company (KPC) will start transporting petroleum through its new Sh48 billion Line Five by the end of this month. Munyes said works on the new 20-inch diameter, 450km pipeline, which is the country’s second largest infrastructural undertaking, will be complete by March 23. “With the completion of this project, Kenya is going to be competitive as a country and the cost of fuel will come down when the line is fully in operation,” said Munyes. He said completion of the project would be a good move for the country because oil retailers will increase supply capacity by about one million litres per hour by the end of this year. Currently, KPC supplies about 730,000 litres per hour through the current Line One, which has been in existence for more than 40 years. “We intend to run the two lines together bringing the capacity to 1.73 million litres per hour,” said KPC managing director Joe Sang. The new line, whose construction started in 2014, will be officially commissioned by President Uhuru later this month. The CS said the completion of the project will lower road maintenance costs given the hundreds of trucks the new line will remove from the Mombasa-Nairobi highway. “With one million litres per hour flow rate, the new line will remove about 700 trucks from the road daily,” he said. He added that, the pipeline will enhance safety because pipeline transportation of fuel is the safest and most cost effective way of ferrying petroleum products the world over. “There will be reduced accidents, fuel fires, and siphoning on our roads hence saving lives and conserving our environment,” said the CS. Munyes said the country is working towards making itself competitive, since Kenya supplies petroleum products to a host of countries including Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi, South Sudan and Congo. “We need to enhance the capacity by three times to meet the demands of these countries,” he said.
