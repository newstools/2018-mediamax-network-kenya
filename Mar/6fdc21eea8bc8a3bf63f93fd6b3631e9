The patients who were caught in a mix up of the infamous brain surgery at the Kenyatta National Hospital have not been given the clean bill of health and have been discharged from hospital. John Mbugua Ndiritu, the patient who had a blood clot in the brain and who was supposed to have been operated on, finally broke his silence, saying he was yet to meet the other patient in the mix-up and that doctors opted to prescribe medication instead of opening him up. This as members of parliament begun collecting signatures in a push to have Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki impeached.
