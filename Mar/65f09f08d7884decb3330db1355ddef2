The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) has advertised vacancies in public primary and secondary schools in Wajir county. In an advertisement in local dailies yesterday, chief executive officer Nancy Macharia announced that there are 585 posts for primary and 315 for secondary schools. “The Teachers Service Commission is advertising 900 posts to fill vacancies in Wajir,” she stated. Macharia appealed to those interested to submit their applications to the TSC County Selection Panels and Boards of Management, not later than March 27. Through the advertisement, eligible candidates should be Kenyan citizens, must be 45 years of age and below, should present original professional and academic certificates and must be registered as teachers as per Section 23 of the TSC Act 2012. She, however, revealed that teachers who are above 45 years can apply to be recruited on a three-year renewable contractual term. The recruitment comes barely a month after two Qarsa Primary School teachers were killed by suspected al Shabaab militants in a dawn attack. The killings prompted teachers unions, the Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) and the Kenya Union of Post Primary Education Teachers (Kuppet), to call for immediate transfer of non-local teachers from the area. They demanded that their members be evacuated from the region until their security is assured.
