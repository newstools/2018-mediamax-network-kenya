The IFC Economic Advisory Board is composed of eminent economists, practitioners and thought leaders who advise the IFC management. The IFC is the financial wing of the World Bank that offers investment, advisory, and asset-management services to encourage private-sector development in developing countries. According to IFC CEO and economics and private sector development vice-president Peter Lankes, Mwangi’s leadership in the private sector made him handy and the World Bank Group believes he can add signiﬁcant value to how IFC executes its mission. “We live in a time of economic volatility, climate change and technology-driven risks and opportunities. How we respond matters to our clients, our development impact, and proﬁtability,” said Lankes. For more than 60 years, IFC has played a key role as a public institution with a development mandate that invests commercially in projects that meet its standards of ﬁnancial and economic return, governance and sustainability. Last year, IFC issued a new strategy, IFC 3.0, which enables it not only to invest in the emerging markets, but also to create markets and mobilise private capital in countries, regions and sectors that have beneﬁted the least from private investment, including the most fragile countries. The new strategy puts a premium on sound economic and strategic advice – where Mwangi’s experience is expected to be useful to IFC. Equity Bank Group has also been able to adopt a new strategy that has seen it grow in Africa. Established in 2014, the IFC Economic Advisory Board meets every six months with IFC’s CEO and Vice Presidents to challenge, contribute to, and enhance IFC’s consideration of its mission in the medium to long-term.
