Kirera Mwiti @PeopleDailyKe The Orange Democratic Movement is still the official Opposition party in Parliament despite the new-found relationship between its leader Raila Odinga and Jubilee’s Uhuru Kenyatta, National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi has said. While welcoming the partnership, Muturi said the party should continue with its constitutional oversight role. He added that the unity deal between Uhuru and Raila will enhance the working environment in Parliament. “This is good development not only for Parliament but also for the country as we need peace for the country to forge forward. It is a great opportunity for MPs to work without acrimony,” he said. Muturi (pictured) was addressing the press in Naivasha after opening a one-week training programme for senior parliamentary staff from 15 Commonwealth countries. The training is organised jointly by McGill University, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Centre for Parliamentary Studies and Training (CPST). Muturi described the training as empowering tool for staff who play a crucial role in Parliament. “This training will help improve the skills and knowledge of the senior staff and will help the National Assembly play its role better,” he said. Keynote speakers included Prof Nyokabi Kamau, the executive director of CPST and Prof Rick Stapenhurst from McGill University, Canada.
