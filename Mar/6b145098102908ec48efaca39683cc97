Mercy Mwai @wangumarci A National Assembly committee investigating the brain surgery mix up that happened early this month at the Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) is expected to table its final report to the House this week. The committee, which conducted its investigations last week, retreated to a Nairobi hotel to write its report in readiness for its tabling in Parliament. Preparing report Health Committee, which is chaired by Murang’a Women’s Rep Sabina Chege, is however expected to meet with the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board (KMPDB) today morning before it starts preparing its report. KMPDB is expected to share with the committee the final details of its report as well as explain how the investigation was carried out. “We are meeting at the Boma hotel where we are going to write our report . We hope to table it either Tuesday or Wednesday so that it can be debated on Thursday,” said one of the MPs in the committee who did not wish to be named. This came on the day the National Nurses Association of Kenya (NNAK) rejected the preliminary report of the KMPDB that implicated nurse Mary Wahome and recommended that she be further probed to determine if she is still fit to serve. In a statement emailed to newsrooms, NNAK national chair Obuya Obengo trashed the KMPDB report saying it is skewed to favour the doctors and cleanse themselves in the court of public opinion. “We take great exception with the preliminary report from the medical and dentist board that attempts to exonerate doctors and blames nurses on the KNH saga,” he said.
