The government is walking the talk in its resolve to fight graft with seven officials at the national youth enterprise development fund  being suspended to allow investigations into  irregular disbursement of loans.
The decision is said to have been taken after an internal  audit report tabled revealed   discrepancies in loan disbursements.
The board chaired by Ronald Osumba has now invited  treasury, and the directorate of criminal  investigations,dci  to investigate any criminal  involvement  by recipients of the loans.
