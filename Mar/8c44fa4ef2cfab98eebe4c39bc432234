Harrison Kivisu @PeopleDailyKe Agriculture Cabinet secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri has extended a warm welcome to Nasa principals Kalonzo Musyoka, Moses Wetang’ula and Musalia Mudavadi to join the unity deal between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga. He said this will enrich the cohesion gospel preached by Uhuru since the divisive August 8 elections. Kiunjuri’s remarks comes a day after Wiper party leader Kalonzo Musyoka expressed willingness to meet the President over their dialogue with Raila. But Kiunjuri (below), while addressing media on the sidelines of the National School Milk conference in Mombasa yesterday, asked the Nasa principals to lead their supporters in embracing development. “The Opposition had a manifesto just like Jubilee. Therefore, it will be very easy for us to work together. We shall look at the manifesto of various parties and once we harmonise them and take this country forward,” said Kiunjuri. Kiunjuri said Raila and Uhuru displayed statesmanship that will end deep ethnic divisions. “Dialogue between leaders is key to resolving the country’s problems,” he said. “Leaders come and go, but our country shall remain. The two leaders demonstrated that they are not selfish by putting aside political differences to unite the country.” Kalonzo said on Wednesday that together with Mudavadi and Wetang’ula, they will seek an appointment with Uhuru for a dialogue when he comes back from his three day official trip to Cuba.
