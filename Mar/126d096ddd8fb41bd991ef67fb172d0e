Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Governors will be at liberty to appoint any member of the County Executive Committee as their designate deputies should a vacancy occur in the office of the deputy governor if proposed amendments to the County Government (Amendment) Act sail through the Senate. Consequently, the deputy governors will also be at liberty to take over as governors if the substantive governor is impeached, resigns or dies. However, if a governor dies before taking oath of office, the deputy governor will only assume office in an acting capacity for 60 days before a by-election is called. The proposals came up during public hearing by the Senate committees on Devolution and Inter-governmental Relations, which proposed amendments to the County Government (Amendment) Bill as well as the draft Impeachment Procedure bill. The legislative proposals are expected to cure the legal gaps faced by the county governments of Nairobi and Nyeri, which have no deputy governors. Makueni Senator Mutula Kilonzo Jnr (pictured) said as senators they are looking for a solution to address the current challenges in law. Busia Senator Amos Wako said they need an urgent solution as in 2005, the country almost suffered a similar problem when retired President Kibaki fired his entire Cabinet after the government sponsored new Constitution flopped at the referendum.
