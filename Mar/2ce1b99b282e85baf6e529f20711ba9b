Steve Umidha @steveumidha Thousands of hawkers and street vendors could soon see their trade legitimised if recommendations of a new draft Bill presented to the Senate sails through. The private member’s Bill sponsored by Murang’a County Governor Mwangi Wa Iria on Tuesday, if adopted, will see structures put in place both at the national and county governments to restore dignity and command respect in the sub-sector – often regarded as a proscribed occupation. The Hawkers and Street Vendors -Protection of Livelihood Bill, also proposes to have hawkers’ zones and vendors’ centres established in towns and along busy highways where hawkers will freely sell their merchandises without intimidation from County askaris. It also calls for the creation of a Street Vendors Authority to be recognised by law that will protect hawkers’ business interests as well as setting up a tribunal to handle their grievances and disputes. “The Bill marks a culmination of efforts to legitimise the livelihood rights of hawkers and street vendors in a way that acknowledges their importance in the urban economy…that hawking and street vending is and can be harnessed to be a major source of employment and poverty alleviation, and that it is not an illegitimate encroachment of public spaces but rather a productive way to earn livelihood and mitigate on age old imbalance,” reads the draft Bill in part. Iria, in his Bill, is also proposing the formation of cooperative societies by hawkers to operate under, for appropriate recognition by institutions such as trade unions and the Kenya National Chamber of Commerce among other bodies.
