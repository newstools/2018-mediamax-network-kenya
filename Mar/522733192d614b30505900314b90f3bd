Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) chief executive officer Lilly Koros has been sent on compulsory leave following an incident where a brain surgery was performed on the wrong patient. Health Cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki suspended Koros and officer in-charge of clinical affairs Benard Githae pending investigations into the gruesome incident. “I have directed the CEO and the colleague responsible for this to proceed on compulsory leave. We will ensure every Kenyan that we are called to serve efficiently, effectively and minimise confusion such as the one we have seen here,” she added. Dr John Ong’ech and Thomas Mutie will now take over the operations of the hospital in an acting capacity as investigations into the incident get underway. It comes even as doctors defended their KNH colleague who conducted the said operation — instead turning their guns on nurses who prepared the patient for surgery. “As unit colleagues, we believe that while our colleague may have exhibited some procedural shortcomings, the surgery was done on the wrong patient mainly because of wrong patient labelling by the ward staff,” the doctors said. Koros’ leadership of the referral hospital has come under sharp scrutiny following a chain of nasty events that have dominated the country’s largest medical facility in the recent past. There has been widespread and condemnation over the incident with Kenyans taking to social media to express their anger. KNH has already acknowledged the embarrassing mix-up that happened on Thursday when a patient had an incorrect procedure performed on him. Apparently, the affected patient only required nursing and medication to stop a swelling on his head but ended up in the theatre for brain surgery. It emerged, the mix-up happened because of confusion over their identification tags, with questions now abound how that could have happened, let alone the surgery.
