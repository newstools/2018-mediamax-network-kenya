I told you pregnancy doesn’t hide for too long. Mama Mtoto has finally begun to show. All the excessive eating and afternoon naps can now be explained. I thought I was making things up, but you guys, she’s actually expecting a baby. While this may be good news for my employer, it might not work out so well for me. I can’t even remember the last time I raised a newborn baby. This might be the time I actually get fired for messing things up. Of more importance is how I will explain to my employer that I can’t help her with the baby once it’s born. She will obviously want to know why and I have no solid answer to that question. To be honest, I am kind of afraid of babies. I once put my niece on my lap and completely forgot. My sister yelled in utter shock when I stood up to go get something in the kitchen almost dropping the baby! If I don’t get fired this time around, maybe I never will. I am, especially curious to see how things will be looking with her husband on paternity leave. Will he even take one? This particular family has a peculiar way of doing things and I am sure with the baby around the corner things might escalate. I dread all the soiled baby clothes I will have to hand wash since she already hinted that the washing machine is out of bound for baby clothes. Maybe she might even employ someone else to look after the children while I do all the other stuff and I hope she does. Until then, we wait.
