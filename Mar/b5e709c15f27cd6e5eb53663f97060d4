The catholic church in partnership with the  Samburu county government has initiated a program to immunise livestock in the region to end  unnecessary loss due to heavy rains. The program which is  targeting   300,000 sheep and goats will go along way to mitigate the loss of livestock due to diseases that affect the animals immediately after the rains start.
