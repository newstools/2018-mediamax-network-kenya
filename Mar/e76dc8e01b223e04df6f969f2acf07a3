Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Kericho Governor Paul Chepkwony and three MPs from the county are demanding the immediate reinstatement of Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) chief executive officer Lily Koros who was sent on compulsory leave on Friday. Their call came as the KNH board announced that it had appointed Dr Thomas Mutie as the acting CEO. Addressing a news conference, the four claimed Koros is being fought because of her firm stand against corruption. They claimed she had declined to approve tenders worth Sh20 billion to certain individuals. They further warned that sending Koros on compulsory leave is against Human Resource practices and abuse of power by Health Cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki. In particular, Chepkwony said allegations of rape of nursing mothers at the facility, the recent incident of a baby being stolen and medical misadventure have been investigated and those found culpable are facing the law. Chepkwony claimed the sustained misrepresentation of facts in relation to the management of KNH is malicious, is in bad faith and undermines the goodwill enjoyed by the Jubilee government in the South Rift. “We, therefore, advise that arbitrary decision by the CS be rescinded forthwith and due process followed,” said Chepkwony. According to the leaders from South Rift region, KNH is a body established by law and has a Board of Management, thus its autonomy should be respected. On Friday last week, Kariuki sent Koros on compulsory leave to allow investigations into a brain surgery mix-up.
