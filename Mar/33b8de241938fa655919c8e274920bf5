Deputy President William Ruto has launched efforts to save Health Cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki from impeachment by Members of Parliament. Reliable sources in Jubilee Party yesterday said Ruto had contacted some MPs and Senators from Rift Valley and asked them to halt the onslaught against the CS. “The DP does not want this thing to go on. He has told us to stop the move against Kariuki. He was not giving an order but he is very serious about it,” said a legislator from Rift Valley. By Friday, sources said about 150 MPs had signed to support a motion to impeach Kariuki, owing to her action to suspend Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH)executive officer Lily Koros. The National Assembly Standing Orders require at least 117 MPs for a motion on the impeachment of a cabinet secretary to be tabled. After Koros’ suspension, the hospital board appointed Thomas Mutie as Acting executive officer, pending investigations. At the same time, MPs from Northern region have joined the anti-Sicily fray. Led by Wajir Woman’s Rep Fatuma Gedi, who accuses the CS of failing to respect the decision of the Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (Kemsa) board to appoint a candidate from the region. They alleged Kemsa had recommended the appointment of Waqo Dulacha instead of Joseph Sitienei and Jonah Mwangi but the interviews were ordered to be repeated. -PD WIKENDI CORRESPONDENT
