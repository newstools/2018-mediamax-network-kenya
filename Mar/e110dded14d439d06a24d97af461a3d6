Thika sub-county children’s officer Rebecca Kariuki has said the parents of the child with 14 needles stuck in her buttocks knew about the minor’s suffering. While giving her testimony in court, she said she discovered that after rescuing the baby from her parents’ home in Kiganjo-Thika for safe custody. “When I was rescuing the couple’s other children from their home in Kiganjo, the elder child said their parents knew of the needles and that the sister kept crying throughout the night,” she told the court. The Children’s officer told the court that they also discovered that the child father Isaac Gichura was living with his two wives in his small rental house in Kiganjo adding that on the day they rescued the child, the second wife was not at home. The two parents; Gichura and Jacinta Ndunge, who are facing charges of subjecting their child to torture had initially told doctors that the child was suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting which she was recuperating from before the needles were discovered at Thika Level 5 Hospital last year. The case will be heard on March 21.
