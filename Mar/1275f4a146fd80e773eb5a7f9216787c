The board of management of the Kenyatta National Hospital has recalled all medical staff who had been suspended pending investigations into the infamous mix-up of identities that saw Neurosurgeons at the hospital opening up the skull of the wrong patient. The decision was arrived at following a consultative meeting between the board, Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki and officials from the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board as well as the Nursing Council of Kenya. The hospital has now transferred the mandate of carrying investigations into the incident to the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Board who are expected to present their report to the health cabinet secretary this Friday. The fate of the hospitalâ€™s Chief Executive Officer Lily Koros who was sent on compulsory leave pending investigations however still hangs in the balance with the board saying they will not be distracted by the political reactions elicited by her suspension.
