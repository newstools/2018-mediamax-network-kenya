A Nairobi court has ordered IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati and six other officials to appear in court on April 9 to testify in a suicide attempt case against former presidential aspirant Peter Solomon Gichira. Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi issued the summons after the Prosecution sought adjournment of case on grounds that witnesses, all Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission employees, failed to appear as they are attending a seminar in Mombasa. “I, therefore, seek summons to all witnesses in this case, including IEBC chairman to appear during the next hearing date,” said prosecutor Solomon Naulikha. However, defence lawyer Dedan Wachira objected to the application for adjournment, saying it would delay the case. Gichira is charged with three counts of attempted suicide, creating disturbance and destroying IEBC property worth Sh134,386. He has since denied the charges and is out on Sh200,000 cash bail. Gichira was arrested last May for attempting to jump off the sixth floor of Anniversary Towers after he was disqualified from the presidential race. The political debutant spent two days at Central Police Station in Nairobi. He is accused of damaging an internet socket, air conditioner machine and a window pane all valued at Sh134,386. Gichira had already won a case against IEBC when the High Court gave him the green light to present his nomination on as an independent candidate.
