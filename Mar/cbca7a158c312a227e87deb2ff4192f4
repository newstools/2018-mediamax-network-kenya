James Magayi @magayijim Ivorian forward Ephrem Guikan’s day went from bad to worse when he was stretchered off the pitch unconscious having swallowed his tongue during Gor Mahia’s goalless Kenyan Premier League (KPL) tie with Tusker at Machakos’ Kenyatta Stadium yesterday. Tusker goalkeeper Duncan Ochieng rammed into Guikan from behind while defending a set piece in the frantic final minutes of the game. Multiple blows from Ochieng’s knee and boot on the Ivorian’s back and head resulted in the Ivorian lying prostate and still. He was rushed to hospital shortly afterwards. Opposition defender Marlon Tangauzi reacted first to Guikan’s predicament and hunched over the Gor Mahia striker in a desperate battle to pull back the tongue before medics rushed to his aid. Moments before, the K’Ogalo forward had committed a probable miss-of-the-season when he failed to score from one metre out and with an empty net yawning before him. Substitute Meddie Kagere squared the ball from the right for Guikan whose first-time shot was blocked by Ochieng but the ball spilt behind the keeper to set him up for probably his villainous moment in football. His affliction soured a momentous encounter whose highlights unfortunately were misses rather than converted opportunities. Despite the draw, Gor Mahia ascended to the league summit, level on points with 2018 revelation Mathare United but K’Ogalo are atop courtesy of a superior goal-count. Tusker too had their moment of near glory in the game, first after 34 minutes when Gor defender Charles Momanyi passed the ball to lanky Tusker forward Robert Achema outside the box. Momanyi realised his folly too late when Achema had exchanged passes with Timothy Otieno but the young defender, signed from Kakamega Homeboyz, was let off the hook easily as Achema blasted over the bar. Meanwhile in Narok, 2009 champions Sofapaka registered their second victory of the season after beating AFC Leopards 2-1 to move to seventh on the log.
