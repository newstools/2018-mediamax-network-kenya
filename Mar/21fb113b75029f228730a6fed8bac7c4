Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Intense leadership row at the National Disaster Management Unit (NDMU) is now threatening to stall operations at a critical time the country is facing disastrous effects of downpour. On Friday, NDMU deputy director of communications Pius Mwachi blew the lid off the underlying internal wrangling and confirmed he is no longer in a position to offer the much-needed coordination assistance since he is “incapacitated”. “I wish to state that it is unfortunate that my fellows Kenyans are calling for my help and support. At the moment, our stakeholders cannot receive my support and collaboration as per the situation as they demand or request. I am incapacitated to offer services in support of humanity as you wish because of the prevailing situation at my place of work in NDMU leadership,” said Mwachi. Mwachi’s exit from the unit has been preceded by apparent differences in public appeals following fire tragedy at Nairobi Central Police Station quarters that Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet disowned and accountability issues of the Kijiji fire in Lang’ata. However, in his statement to newsrooms Friday, Mwachi claimed he is in good terms with Boinnet and the police command. “ I would like to let everyone understand well that the current prevailing situation is internal conflict within NDMU rank and file. I am in good terms with Boinnet, entire police leadership and our stakeholders,” Mwachi added. However, he urged the public to report emergency or disaster incidents, calling through hotline numbers 999, 911 and 112.
