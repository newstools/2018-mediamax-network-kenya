Roy Lumbe @PeopleSports11 Female light fly-weight boxer Veronica Mbithe has been dropped from the national boxing team by the technical commission after she landed a job with the Kenya Defence Forces KDF). Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) president John Kameta said Mbithe was dropped from the team after the KDF instructed her to concentrate on her new duties. “We are inspired and disappointed in equal measure as she will not make it to the Gold Coast games. However, it is the desire of every player to land such an opportunity when it comes knocking,” said Kimeta. Kameta spoke when he visited the national boxing team residential training camp in Nakuru over the weekend. However, he ruled out of getting her replacement owing to the tedious process of acquiring visas and other logistics. Kameta said he had tried to convince KDF to allow the young female boxer attend the Gold Coast Games but all ended in vain owing to the strict military rules could not allow her to serve the team at the moment. The new development leaves three female boxers in flyweight Christine Ongare, welter Lorna Kusa and middleweight Elizabeth Andiego in ‘The Hit Squad’. He named three coaches in coach Patrick Maina, assistant coach Patrick ‘Mont’ Waweru and trainer John Waweru as the ones who will handle the 10 players who include seven male pugilists to be captained by 2010 Commonwealth Games bantamweight silver medallist Benson Gicharu. Others are light fly Shaffi Bakari, fly Brian Agina, light Nick Okoth, middle Edwin Okong’o, light heavy Nick Abaka and heavyweight Elly Ajowi.
