The political battle between Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru and former Justice and Constitutional Affairs minister Martha Karua has moved to new heights. The Court of Appeal Friday asked the High Court to hear afresh the petition filed by Karua, the Narc Kenya Party leader, challenging the election of Waiguru. However, Waiguru said she would move to the Supreme Court to challenge the Court of Appeal’s ruling. Karua’s appeal is the first petition the Court of Appeal has set aside arising from the August 8 election, meaning the petition, in which Karua wants Waiguru’s election annulled, goes back to the High Court for hearing. Justices Mohamed Warsame, Daniel Musinga and Otieno Odek set aside the striking out of Karua’s petition by Kerugoya High Court, in which she claims Waiguru was not validly elected, and ordered a fresh hearing by another judge. The judges faulted Lady Justice Lucy Gitari of Kerugoya High Court for dismissing the suit despite the petition raising weighty issues. The judgment, read by Justice Warsame, also found Justice Gitari for failing to appreciate the role of courts in considering disputes irrespective of whether issues raised were insignificant or not. The judges said Karua raised serious allegations that required the judge to investigate and determine instead of prematurely striking out the petition . They agreed with Karua that Justice Gitari unfairly dismissed her petition on technicality grounds that she omitted the election results and dates declared in her petition. The case was thrown out despite conclusion of pre-trial and fixing of a hearing date. The judges said striking out the petition on such grounds without examining other fundamental aspects of the case was equal to miscarriage of justice. The court also set aside Sh10 million that the court had slapped on Karua, saying it was excessive and a form of punishment to deter Kenyans from accessing court justice. It awarded Karua Sh2 million as cost of appeal.
