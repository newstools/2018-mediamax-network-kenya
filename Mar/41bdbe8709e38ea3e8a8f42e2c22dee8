Barry Silah @obel_barry Kibera Black Stars are causing ripples in the National Super League (NSL), and all this boils down to belief in the team. The Kibra slum-based side currently tops the standings with 13 points after an enviable run in the division this season. With five rounds down, the team that finished the last campaign 10th on the log might be forgiven for feeling a breath of freshness and renewed ambition. According to coach Godfrey ‘Solo’ Oduor, the aspect of giving youth a chance to express their talent is the biggest winner. ”There is no magic really, but I have to say my players are doing justice to their budding careers. We work hard as a unit so there is no fluke and the confidence therein makes work a bit easier for us. Obviously, we are keen to improve and that is what we always strive to do daily with the boys,” said the youthful tactician who has been at the helm for three years. Oduor also praised the impact of the community in ensuring the environment is football friendly. “It is a work in progress but definitely we are grateful for our partners and the people around for believing in us. What makes our brand appealing is simply because we have a vision and we are always constantly working towards it,” he said. Another big asset for the NSL side is that a big chunk of their players have been together for almost four years and coach Oduor believes that is a good opportunity to explore. “Chemistry is important so that consistency is achieved. I am happy with the squad at hand who we have a project to deliver together,” he said. Meanwhile KCB coach John Kamau has suggested that his team still needs time to gel as they have began the campaign on a low. The bankers are currently 10th on the log with seven points and have been seemingly struggling for consistency thus far.
