Opposition leader Raila Odinga moved to downplay conflicts in Nasa by insisting that the coalition was intact even as the three other co-principals mooted a new alliance. The three — Moses Wetang’ula (Ford Kenya), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper) and Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) — met Friday morning to strategise on the next course of action and threatened to kick Raila and his ODM party out of Nasa. A statement issued by Lugari MP Ayub Savula, who is also the ANC deputy party leader, said they are scheduled to launch a new Nasa Alliance in Kakamega on Saturday. The new outfit will bring together ANC, Ford Kenya and Wiper. “The three parties will discuss and strategise the way forward in which they will choose and support one leader who will run for presidency in the 2022 elections,” Savula said in a statement. But speaking in Kisii, Raila insisted that no Nasa principal was either leaving or being axed from the coalition. Addressing mourners at Mosocho during the funeral of Prof Aloys Tumbo Oeri, 70, the former Prime Minister said he agreed to sign a Memorandum of Understanding with President Uhuru Kenyatta after he agreed to embrace dialogue to unite the country. Raila, who spoke for the first time in public after the historic handshake with Uhuru at Harambee House, said the agreement was not selfish and told his co-principals not to panic over what he and the President discussed. Raila was accompanied by Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Governor James Ongwae (Kisii), Senator Prof Sam Ongeri (Kisii), MPs Simba Arati (Dagoretti North) Vincent Kemosi (West Mugirango), Richard Onyonka and (Kitutu Chache South). “I decided that we forget the past, build bridges and unite all Kenyans for the country to realise development,” Raila said. He said the MoU was not a Jubilee Party or a Nasa affair, adding that it is aimed at uniting Kenyans and boosting development. — Seth Onyango
