One thing most people do not know about you? I’m shy, especially with women. It’s a bit embarrassing, but it happens to me a lot. What’s the nicest thing someone has ever told you? That I’m great and they admire my creativity. That stood out for me. Best and worst highlights of your life? My worst was when my mum passed on in 1996. My best was being nominated for the Maranatha Awards for the Best Thanksgiving song that I featured in Cal The Brand. What are your worst moments out of your busy schedule? I’m forgetful. Last year, I remember I was mceeing at an event and I had everything planned. When it was two minutes to the time the event was starting, I realised that I had left my shoes (the one I purposed to wear at the event). I had to borrow rubber shoes and continue with the programme! Favourite object that would complete your home? Any ancient object. Also, a large piano would come in handy. What was your best childhood nickname? I never had one, my name stood out. Some of your worst habits? I’m a workaholic to an extent of sidelining everything that comes as a distraction at my work place. Best place you always like to go and think? Malindi. I also like visiting Kiboko Bay in Kisumu. Such a beautiful place. What is the strangest talent you have? Dancing like a woman. Sounds weird, right? What’s the worst thing all your love interests had? They are tough and hard-headed. Best age that you have ever lived? My 30s. I learnt a lot and with God, I realised everything is possible. Best childhood memories? Family gatherings. Food was in plenty. Playing during the rainy season was also fun.
