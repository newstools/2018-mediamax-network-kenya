Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah Water and Sanitation Cabinet secretary Simon Chelugui has urged Kenyans to take advantage of the ongoing rains to harvest water to supplement efforts by the government to address challenges. He said the government had prioritised storm water harvesting noting that 57 dams are at an advanced stage of construction across the country. Chelugui said it is unfortunate that rain water is going to waste every rainy season. “We need to manage this and that is why the government has come up with a national master plan to solve this problem.” In an interview with a local TV station, Chelugui said the government was in the process of building a mega dam in Narok county adding that works at the Sh38 billion Itare dam in Kuresoi North, Nakuru country is progressing well. He said the National Water and Pipeline Corporation will soon be transformed to National Water Harvesting and Storage Corporation noting that this is the body that will ensure the 80 per cent water coverage target is achieved in the next three years.
