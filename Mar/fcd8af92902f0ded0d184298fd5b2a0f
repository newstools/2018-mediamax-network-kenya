The board of the Kenyatta National Hospital has Friday submitted its preliminary report on investigations into a surgery mix-up to the ministry of health with a raft of recommendations on how to improve services at the referral facility. Among other proposals, the board has recommended a review of the working hours and schedules of clinical staff, strict enforcement of tagging of patients and the use of marker pens to map out surgical sites on patients scheduled for operation. The report was submitted even as services at the hospital remained partially paralyzed with registrar doctors staying away despite the lifting of a suspension of four medical staff involved in the surgery mix-up.
