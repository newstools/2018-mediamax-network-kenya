Kawangware United’s began their Super 8 Premier League title defence on a low after suffering a humiliating 5-0 loss to arch rivals Ngando Youth United (NYSA) FC during the Ngong derby at Ngong Posta ground at the weekend. Lanky forward Collins Muema exhibited his scoring prowess by netting a hat-trick with Zacharia Zedine and Eli Tsanai also finding the back of the net to hand coach Francis Thairu a reality check. At Camp Toyoyo grounds, Jericho FC showed their hunger for the title that has eluded them for the past two years by ruthlessly thrashing new kids on the block RYSA FC 7-1 in a one-sided affair. Striker Bandu Engo scored the fastest three goals in the history of the competition after beating RYSA’s goalkeeper in the 14th 19th and 22nd minutes before Victor Walera, John Awala, Warren Bosire and Caleb Olilo each scored to hand them a huge goal difference. RYSA got their consolation through Joseph Karimi. Despite the huge win, Jericho captain Kelvin Omondi has warned his team-mates against complacency. “Today’s match was enjoyable because we made good use of the several chances we created and converted them. An emphatic win at the beginning of the season is real morale booster and we hope to remain focused in the coming fixtures,” said Omondi. Meanwhile, 2016 champions Kayole Asubuhi failed to impress their home fans who had gathered at Calvary ground, as they went down 1-0 to Shauri Moyo Blue Stars while Rongai All Stars made their league debut with a 2-1 win over Melta Kabiria. Team Umeme and Shauri Moyo Sportiff beat Leads United and Zamalek FC respectively.
