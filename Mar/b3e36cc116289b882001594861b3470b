Siaya Senator James Orengo is the new Senate Minority Leader after a section of NASA senators made good their threat to vote out NASA co principal and Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetangâ€™ula as senate minority leader. Senate speaker Kenneth Lusaka dismissed a late attempt to save Wetangula after ruling that a letter from NASA Chief Executive Norman Magaya which was seeking to retain him as minority leader- had not been submitted through the office of the minority whip as required by the standing orders of the house.
