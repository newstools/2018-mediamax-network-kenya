George Kebaso @Morarak National Super Alliance’s (Nasa) principals yesterday held a meeting in Nairobi and demanded the reconstitution of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), failure to which they will boycott the 2022 election. They also said IEBC does not have the capacity to carry out the boundaries review scheduled for next year. The principals, Raila Odinga (ODM) (pictured), Kalonzo Musyoka (Wiper), Musalia Mudavadi (ANC) and Moses Wetang’ula, also called for talks with the Jubilee government on pressing national matters. The leaders accused Jubilee of sponsoring a bill by Tiaty MP William Kamket (Kanu) which seeks to create the position of executive prime minister and ceremonial president. “The coalition therefore wants Jubilee to come clean on the bill,” the leaders said in a statement. They agreed to put aside debate on the 2022 election and instead pursue electoral reforms as their main agenda. “The coalition asks all its members to equally put singular focus on electoral justice and vacate all discussions of 2022 elections. Nasa remains firm that there can be no elections in 2022 unless the causes of the irregularities and illegalities witnessed in 2017 are fully identified and addressed,” they said. A source revealed that the coalition will soon convene a joint Parliamentary Group meeting to cement its position on several matters, particularly on electoral reforms. The principals met amid growing suspicions in the coalition over a number of issues including who will be its flagbearer in the next polls.
