BARRY SILAH AND LYNETTE MATHEKA Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) sponsored Talanta FC silence Coast Stima in a Friday National Super League match at rain-drenched Toyoyo Grounds in Jericho. Job Tinyo scored the all-important goal for the victors in the 57th minute as the weekend fixtures for the fourth weekend rolled off in earnest. In what is expected to be the highlight of the weekend, Western Stima are hosting Nairobi’s Kangemi All Stars in a National Super League match that has all the indicators of a thriller. Stima have won two of their three matches and drawn in one while Kangemi have won as many matches and lost one. The former are yet to concede a goal in their three matches and have scored three while the later has scored five times and conceded twice. Kibera All Stars are hoping to keep their unbeaten run when they face winless Administration Police (AP) at Jericho’s Camp Toyoyo grounds. Kibera boast of seven points from two wins and a draw while AP are yet to bag a point. The Kibera match will be preceded by a clash between Ushuru FC and Kenya Police at 2pm. The two are tied at four points and placed ninth and 10th respectively. However, Police have a match in hand having played two matches. In another encounter Nakuru All Stars host St Joseph’s Youth at Afraha Stadium as the hosts chase their first win of the season. The Nakuru-based side lie at the bottom of the 18-team league. St Joseph’s are equally looking for a first win having played to three consecutive draws. The side are also chasing a first goal of the season having bagged the tree points from goalless draws. At Thika Stadium, hosts Bidco United, unbeaten in three matches, are chasing a second win against Eldoret’s GFE who are yet to record a win. The latter have lost two matches and drew in one. Ushuru vs Kenya Police (Camp Toyoyo 2pm) Nakuru All Stars vs St Joseph Youth (Afraha Stadium 3pm); Western Stima vs Kangemi All Stars (Moi Kisumu 3pm).
