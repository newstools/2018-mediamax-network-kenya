Robion Obino @Obinorobin The construction of Phase 2A of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) has been thrown off-track following a legal battle over its environmental effects. The tussle pitting Kenya Railways Corporation (KR), China Road bosses and an environmental conservation lobby group, the Kenya Coalition for Wildlife Conservation and Management (KCWCM), may now delay the construction, which started on Friday last week. KCWCM yesterday petitioned Kenya Railways Corporation and the Parliamentary Committee on Environment seeking to stop the hiving off of 110 acres from Nairobi National Park. KCWCM chairman Sydney Quantai says tens of animals, mostly giraffes, have since been displaced “Many animals have been displaced since Friday. And this is just the start,” Quantai said yesterday as conservationists calling themselves Friends of Nairobi National Park marched in protest against the contractors and proponents of the project for defying court orders.
