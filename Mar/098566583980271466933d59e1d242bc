Paris, Thursday @Peoplesports11 Brazilian superstar Neymar will undergo surgery on his fractured foot in Brazil as early as Thursday, ruling the world’s most expensive footballer out of Paris Saint-Germain’s do-or-die Champions League clash with Real Madrid. The 26-year-old suffered a hairline fracture of the fifth metatarsal in his right foot as well as a twisted ankle late in PSG’s 3-0 win over Marseille in Ligue 1 on Sunday. PSG said Wednesday that Rodrigo Lasmar, the surgeon with the Brazilian national squad, will carry out the operation with several Brazilian media outlets reporting that the surgery would take place as early as Thursday. Radio Tupi said Neymar, his father and surgeon Lasmar left Paris Wednesday night for Belo Horizonte’s Mater Dei Hospital where the operation is set for Thursday according to O Globo newspaper, one of Brazil’s leading dailies. Website UoL also reported the surgery would take place in the southeastern Brazil city but said it was scheduled for Sunday. On Tuesday, the Brazilian’s father had claimed the player would be out for “at least six weeks”. Speaking to ESPN in Brazil before PSG’s announcement, Neymar Senior said: “PSG know that they will not be able to count on Neymar for the upcoming matches. His treatment will last six to eight weeks, whether there is an operation or not.” PSG coach Unai Emery had said earlier that “no decision” had been taken on whether Neymar would require surgery and that there remained a “small chance” of getting him back in time to face Real next Tuesday, March 6. PSG lost 3-1 in the first leg in Spain two weeks ago and are in danger of being knocked out of the competition in the last 16 for the second season running. Neymar appeared to be in tears as he was stretchered off the field at the Parc des Princes on Sunday. -AFP
