The political future of outspoken Nandi Hills MP Alfred Keter has been cast into limbo after the High Court in Eldoret nullified his election during last yearâ€™s August 8th election. Keter who has fallen out with his Jubilee party was nullified barely a week after the election of another rebel MP Kangogo Bowen of Marakwet East was reversed. Gatundu North MP Wanjiku Kibe and her Ugenya counterpart David Karan were also going back drawing board after their elections were nullified by the high court in Kiambu and Kisumu respectively Thursday.
