Governor Francis Kimemia welcome the gesture, saying it will help address the main challenges faced by the potato farmers. “Acquiring high quality propagation materials has been a major challenge which makes Nyandarua farmers recycle the harvested potato tubers, a practice that reduces production, he said during a meeting with Ireland officials. Ireland’s embassy representative Boxer Moran promised the county that the farmers will get certified and affordable seed materials. Most Nyandarua farmers currently use traditional farming methods which lead to low yields. However, Ireland promised to help in extension services to optimise profitability of the crop. “The overall farming method will aim at commercialising production of the crop in a model similar to the Irish,” said Moran. Ireland which greatly employs farm mechanisation which has made it a top producer of potatoes in Europe also promised to help link farmers to the market. Exploitation by middle men has greatly demoralised potato production in Nyandarua.
