Wangui Githugo, Yusuf Masibo and Mathew Ndung’u @PeopleDailyKe Operations at the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) main offices in Nairobi’s Upper hill area were paralysed yesterday morning after teachers from Wajir stormed the premises demanding transfers over escalating insecurity. Teachers from Wajir county stormed the offices demanding their transfers but were repulsed by police officers who lobbed tear gas canisters at them. The teachers’ move comes a week after TSC boss Nancy Macharia said non-local teachers in the area would be moved from rural to urban areas to minimise attacks and make it easy for security agencies to take immediate action on their distress calls. Meanwhile, Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) has threatened to move their members from Mt Elgon if the government fails to protect them from attacks by a criminal gang reigning terror in the area. The union claims so far 36 people including men, women and children have been killed in the region following a wave of insecurity that has hit the area in the past six months. Area Knut executive secretary Stephen Chemonges said it was unfortunate that the criminal gangs were targeting even women and girls whom they rape, defile and kill. And in Thika, Knut secretary Joe Mungai has lauded TSC for transferring teachers from North Eastern region over insecurity. In a letter, TSC gave non-local teachers from Wajir 14 day’s directive to make plans to report to their new stations.
