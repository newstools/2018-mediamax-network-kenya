Kenya Pipeline began their hunt for an eighth continental title with a morale-boosting 3-0 victory of (25-23, 25-22, 25-21) over Shams of Egypt as the women’s African Club Championship served off at Ahly Hall in Cairo on Tuesday night. Pipeline showed consistency as they overcame Shams in a marathon 84 minutes of the Pool C match but they were made to sweat given the narrow margins of victory in each set. Shams led regularly in the first set and were near to win it when Pipeline rebounded to claim it narrowly 25-23. Pipeline had the upper hand in the second and third sets to clinch the important victory. The reigning national league champions will now be hoping to make it two straight group wins today when they take on Uganda’s Vision to put them in a good position ahead of tomorrow’s and Saturday’s meeting with DGSP of Congo and Cameroon’s FAP on Friday and Saturday respectively. Meanwhile, David Lugh’aho’s Kenya Prisons—who opened their campaign against Customs of Nigeria last night—will take on Asec of Cote d’Ivoire today with clashes against Douanes of Burkina Faso and Injs of Cameroon awaiting tomorrow and Saturday. Kenyan clubs have struggled to reclaim the continental silverware since 2013 when Prisons clinched it in Madagascar before the rise of North African clubs.
