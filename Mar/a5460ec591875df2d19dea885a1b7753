Limping giants Maseno School are plotting a major comeback in the secondary schools championships that they hostnext weekend. The former East Africa rugby 15s and boys’ basketball champions hopes to regain their rightful place in the secondary school games. Maseno lost the Lake Region Secondary Schools Sports and Kisumu County as well as the national basketball titles last year and coach Gordon Ogutu is optimistic that his charges are now ready for the ultimate prize. He termed the loss to Kisumu Boys at County level as brutal saying his boys have promised to bounce back and bask into glory. “In December we had a very promising and successful holiday camp featuring all the disciplines and we remain upbeat that it will prove positive ahead of the gruelling battle ahead,” he noted. Ogutu have been struggling to fit in the shoes of former master Paul Otula since he took over the basketball-coaching role following the unprecedented suspension of the Kenya Basketball Federation (KBF) national chairman in last year. “We have had a share of the challenge but we are doing our best to get out of it, it’s a high call coaching a team like Maseno,” he said. The once a sports powerhouse, will begin their journey to excellence next week when the Kisumu County Term One Games kick off in their school. Maseno have their work cut out for them as they seek to reclaim the county and regional as well as national trophy this year. “We are prepared well and not just ready to lose again, we are charged well motivated and focused, we leant our lessons the hard way and winning will be a great redemption for us, our focus is on the national trophy but we will have to deal with the obstacles at the county and regional levels,” he said.
