Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah Retired President Daniel Moi is back in the country after spending the last five days in Tel Aviv, Israel receiving treatment. Speaking to the People Daily on the phone yesterday, Moi’s Press Secretary Lee Njiru said the former Head of State landed at the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport on Saturday at around 7pm. Njiru said Moi was in high spirits and recuperating at his Kabarnet Gardens home in Nairobi. “He received First Class treatment and everything was successful,” he said. The aging retired president was flown to Israel on March 11 over what his aides described as a troubling knee. He was accompanied by his son Gideon Moi, who is also the Senator for Baringo, and his personal doctor Dr David Silverstain.
