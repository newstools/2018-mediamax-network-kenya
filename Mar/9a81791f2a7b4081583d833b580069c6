US President Donald Trump has fired Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and nominated CIA Director Mike Pompeo to succeed him, replacing his top diplomat ahead of a potential high-stake talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Reports have since emerged that Tillerson who had just concluded a four day tour of Kenya where he held talks with President Kenyatta was recalled from official duty in the West African country of Chad.
