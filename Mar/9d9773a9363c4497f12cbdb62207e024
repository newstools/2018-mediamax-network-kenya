Robin Obino @obinorobin President Uhuru Kenyatta’s administration could have prevented the current financial crisis had it read the early warning signs, Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu-K) has said. Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli said the crisis is a result of unethical hiking of cost of projects from millions to billions of shillings. He claimed projects that had been initiated by former President Mwai Kibaki had budgets of millions but now are being implemented at billions of shillings. “Hiking project costs is being done so that some people can benefit largely through corruption,” he said in a statement sent to newsrooms on Friday. Cotu had in 2015 warned the government against over-borrowing, which is now crippling the economy. The statement comes barely a month after the country acquired Sh200 billion ($2 billion) in a new sovereign bond. The bond, which was listed at the London Stock Exchange (LSE) in February, was highly oversubscribed attracting bids worth Sh1.4 trillion. Treasury said acquisition of the bond was an indication of confidence in long-term prospects of the Kenyan economy by international investors. However, Cotu says the huge borrowing has seen the shilling lose strength against other international currencies. “Reports from Auditor General Edward Ouko and Treasury Cabinet Secretary Henry Rotich have proved we are in a financial crisis,” the statement read. Cotu’s concerns come against a backdrop of arguments from some economists, who have defended the government’s appetite for borrowing despite concerns that the country’s debt is rising to unsustainable levels. The statement further read, “Uhuru Kenyatta should to be assertive and stamp out misuse of public funds by the people around him, who even want to change the law on pension funds to access National Social Security Fund (NSSF) money as they have done with other Institutions.”
