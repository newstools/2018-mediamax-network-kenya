James Momanyi @jamomanyi The Canadian government yesterday signed a Sh2 billion partnership deal with the department of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) that will support more than 1,200 students from ten local national polytechnics to pursue in demand courses under the new competence-based curriculum. The five-year project (2016-2021), which will be implemented under the Kenya Education for Employment Program (KEFEP), will also equip the institutions with state-of-the-art equipment and strengthen skills of more than 200 local TVET trainers to deliver high quality competency-based education and training. The programme will be implemented by a group of 17 Canadian colleges and institutes under the banner, Colleges and Institutes Canada (CICan), who will be tasked to build the capacity of two government agencies and the 10 national polytechnics to that they can deliver quality, relevant and accessible training programmes for the youth. Speaking during the signing ceremony at Kabete National Polytechnic, the Director of TVET Mesack Opwora said that the goal of the partnership is to enhance and advance collaboration between the private sector and TVET institutions to equip the youth with in-demand skills for agriculture and energy sectors or proceed to be entrepreneurs. “Previously as a country we have been having a skills mismatch between what we train and what is needed in the industries and job market. We are now addressing that as a government by reforming the TVET sector by introducing as new curriculum developed together with the industry and partners,” he said. The TVET director said the government has been rebranding the TVET sector in the last few years by developing a new curriculum, equipping the technical and vocational institutions with modern equipment, building the capacity of the trainers and involving the industry and partners to develop market-driven programmes. The KEFEP senior technical advisor Moritz Schmidt said the competence-based programme will only focus on the engineering and technological sectors such as electrical, civil and mechanical engineering; mechatronics, automotive technology, building technology, renewable energy technology, and agricultural technology.
