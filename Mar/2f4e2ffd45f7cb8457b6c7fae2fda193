In an effort to seal loopholes in the Lands and Physical Planning ministry, the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) has launched an examination report to audit systems, policies, procedures and practices of the ministry. The aim of the report is to identify weaknesses and loopholes inherent in the systems that provide opportunities for corruption and recommends ways of ensuring efficiency, integrity and accountability in service delivery. Speaking during the launch of the report at Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) in Nairobi yesterday, Lands Cabinet secretary Faridah Karoney admitted that there are challenges and the issues raised in the report are true but assured Kenyans that her ministry is committed to ensure that the recommendations of the report are implemented. EACC chairperson Eliud Wabukala urged the CS to work steadfast and seal corruption loopholes identified by the report.
