Automobile battery manufacturer, Associated Battery Manufacturers (ABM) has become the first firm to achieve the one million pieces mark in the East and Central African region. Group chief executive officer Guy Jack said that achieving production of one million batteries within a year, has been the culmination of a successful three-year group strategy, supported by $20 million (Sh2 billion) in new investment and aggressive market expansion. He also attributed the firm’s continued success in a tough economic and manufacturing environment to “Company Culture”. Jack said the battery manufacturing plant located in the industrial area, is a testament to local manufacturing capabilities relative to global standards. ABM’s state-of-the-art plant established in 1963 is one of few remaining manufacturing giants in East Africa, with its flagship brand, Chloride Exide.
