Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe There was commotion at Jacaranda Hotel, Nairobi, when Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) auctioneers raided the facility over unpaid tax remittances amounting to Sh400 million. Business at the four-star hotel was temporarily paralysed as the auctioneers took away goods from the facility in Westlands, Nairobi. However, the items were not carted away after the hotel directors committed to pay a partial settlement of Sh75 million. “We have good working relations with KRA. We were able to raise Sh75million in two hours,” said Samuel Wanjema Karume, who was accompanied by Jane Mukuhi Karume. According to the late tycoon Njenga Karume’s children, the now owners of the Karume empire, KRA is demanding Sh400 million for three years un-reflected tax dues. Last month, the hotel moved to court challenging a tax demand of Sh197 million by the taxman, which is part of the unreconciled figure of Sh400 million. In January, the hotel was served with a letter notifying it of an auction to recover the money. However, through their lawyer Milly Odari, the hotel moved to the High Court arguing that KRA had declined its offer to offset the arrears in installments. The taxman initially demanded Sh197 million, requiring Jacaranda to pay Sh72 million for Value Added Tax (VAT) and Sh81 million for Pay as You Earn (PAYE). Both VAT and PAYE, according to KRA, attracted a penalty of Sh19 million and an interest of Sh23 million. The hotel has claimed it is unable to immediately settle the debt. Before the former minister died, he shared his property among his children and wife but left his companies under a trust composed of George Waireri, Henry Karume, Kung’u Gatabaki and Margaret Kamithi. Karume’s family now wants professionals to take over from the current trustees.
