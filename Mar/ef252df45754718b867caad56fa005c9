Charles Okwemba @charlito56 Zetech University held a career exhibition in a bid to equip Kenyans with important information regarding university education. “Not many parents and students are clear on opportunities available in universities, and what options they can pursue with regard to grades attained. They should not feel defeated and lost, but they should be furnished with full information from experts on joining credible institutions. At Zetech, we have invested in these regular exhibitions to meet this need,” said Alice Njuguna, Zetech University Deputy Vice Chancellor in charge of Academics, Research and Extension. Featuring the various departments, the four-day activity, which took place in Nairobi and Ruiru, Kiambu County, was a rewarding experience for many as the university brought information to clients and provided them with a rare opportunity to talk directly to faculty heads and lecturers on key aspects of different courses. The exhibition, which happens in the wake of the released 2017 KCSE results saw the Faculty of Business team set up a station to enlighten participants on the course while the institution’s business students capitalised on the sessions to apply skills gained by selling various products and services on site. The school of IT and Engineering displayed various innovations and engaged guests on the important role of technology in solving problems around the world. The Registrar of Academics, Moses Maina said that the place of IT in the world informs the curriculum and training at Zetech, “with the aim of equipping students with the skills to create solutions during the time of study and beyond the classroom,” he said.
