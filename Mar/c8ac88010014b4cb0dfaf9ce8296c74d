Oliver Musembi @PeopleDailyKe University lecturers who are on strike have been warned against engaging in part-time teaching. Officials of the Kenya University Staff Workers Union (Kusu) and Universities Academic Staff Union (Uasu) said they would disown any member who decides to take up jobs during the boycott. The warning was issued by Uasu secretary-general Constantine Wesonga, his Kusu counterpart Charles Mukhwaya and Uasu national chairman Muga K’Olale when they launched the nationwide strike at Kenyatta University and Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology on Friday. Mukhwaya also warned vice-chancellors against intimidating striking employees or using underhand methods to undermine the boycott. “The matter is now beyond any individual vice-chancellor. Let them not engage workers in useless meetings because this is now between the unions and the government,” he said. Mukhwaya said they decided to stop working after the Inter-Public Universities Consultative Council Forum (Ipuccf) failed to effect a collective bargaining agreement. At the same time, the unionists said workers in public universities should be included in the national budget-making process. Wesonga said public universities were last year allocated Sh33 billion of the education sector’s Sh99 billion vote but lamented the institutions were not involved in the budget making process. The officials said they would not relent in their push for the signing of a collective bargaining agreement which they observed was two years in arrears.
