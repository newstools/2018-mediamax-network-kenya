Fred Likuyani and Barry Silah @Peoplesports11 Kakamega High School’s Green Commandos are finding life tough in the second tier National Super League (NSL) after failing to win yet again, following a 3-1 defeat to Modern Coast Rangers at Bukhungu Stadium yesterday. It was a game of two halves with the hosts starting the match on a bright note as Micheal Gavogi and Henry Alola found too much space in the visitors’ box but remained wasteful. Modern Coast saw winger David Arem’s 55th minute goal ruled out for offside but he was not to be denied a minute later, when he put his team ahead via a shot in the bottom corner Ten minutes later, Dominic Waithaka extended the lead from a half volley just outside the box before substitute Ramadhan Kambu wrapped up the scores a few minutes later. Rayon Ashiono scored the consolation goal for the home team in the 85th minute as Green Commanods remained 15th on the log from two draws and as many losses while Modern Coast moves to fourth with nine points. Meanwhile, Ushuru and Western Stima, two of the most experienced teams in the NSL face stern tests this afternoon. The pair, who have had a contrasting run so far, will come up against equally ambitious opponents in the shape of Nairobi City Stars and Kibera Black Stars. Title contenders, Ushuru handled by Ken Kenyatta, have had a torrid fortnight, losing back-to-back matches against rivals KCB and Kenya Police and will be keen to bounce back in the mid-day clash against City Stars. However, the 14th placed taxmen will not have it easy against gritty City Stars, who are now enjoying a good run. Ushuru will also remember that John Amboko’s City Stars took away four points from them last year which contributed to their failure to gain Kenyan Premier League promotion. In the other tie, Western Stima and second-placed Kibera Black Stars face each other in a top of the table clash. The two, both on 10 points, are yet to lose a match and are only separated by goal difference.
