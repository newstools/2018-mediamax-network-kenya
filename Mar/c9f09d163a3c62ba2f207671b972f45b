Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah Retired President Daniel arap Moi was yesterday discharged from Ichalov Hospital in Tel Aviv, Israel where he has been receiving treatment for the last four days. A statement by his communications handler Lee Njiru said the former Head of State underwent a series fruitful of medical check-ups at the hospital. “The former president who is in a jovial mood and in good spirits will spend the day visiting some Holy sites in Isreal and the city of Jerusalem,” the statement said. Moi, 93, was flown to Israel on Sunday for specialised treatment for what his aides described as troubling knee. He is accompanied by son Gideon, who is also the Senator for Baringo and his personal doctor Dr David Silverstein among others. The ageing former Head of State has taken a low profile in the last few years and was last seen in public on October 26 after he cast his vote in the repeat presidential election. On Wednesday, Njiru said Moi was in high spirits and would be back home soon. At the same time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had to issue a report discounting reports on social media over the well-being of the former president.
