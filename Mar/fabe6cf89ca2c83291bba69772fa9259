DPPS Deputy President William Ruto yesterday asked leaders to put aside political differences and unite in addressing national development challenges. He said unity and teamwork remains key in the implementation of the government’s Big Four agenda of manufacturing, housing, healthcare and food security. He urged MPs and the county governments to align their programmes in line with the government’s agenda because the move was aimed at transforming livelihoods. Addressing MPs from Meru county who called on him at his Karen office, Ruto said the government was committed towards ensuring national unity, peace and development. “As I congratulate you on being elected as MPs in your respective constituencies, I ask you to put aside political differences, unite and take a common stand on matters of development because that is why we were elected,” he said. The MPs included Mithika Linturi (Meru), Moses Kirima (Central Imenti), Rahim Dawood (North Imenti), Mwirabua Kabeabea (Tigania East), Kathuri Murungi (South Imenti), Kanyuithia Mutunga (Tigania West), Kubai Iringo (Igembe Central) and Rindikiri Murwethania (Buuri). Ruto assured the leaders of the government’s commitment in initiating development projects that have direct impact on the lives of Kenyans across the country, saying voters re-elected Jubilee because of development track record. He singled out water and roads as some of the key projects the Government would give priority in Meru county because they were the major concerns for residents. “We have plans to construct dams in your county to give residents enough water for domestic and irrigation purposes,” said Ruto.
