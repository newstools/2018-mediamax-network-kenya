Embattled businessman Jimmy Wanjigi has been granted a reprieve after the High Court sitting in Nairobi issued temporary orders stopping the magistrateâ€™s court in Nyeri from proceeding with criminal proceedings against him until a case filed in Nairobi is heard and determined. The orders were issued hours after Wanjigi failed to personally appear in court in Nyeri and was ordered to make his appearance on Monday next week.
