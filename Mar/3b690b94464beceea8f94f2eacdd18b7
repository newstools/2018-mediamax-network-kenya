Controversial lawyer-cum-politician Miguna Miguna is free to return home following his contested deportation on allegations of being a national security risk. The Court of Appeal ruled yesterday that the State had not provided any convincing grounds to demonstrate that Miguna’s return is likely to provoke civil disobedience or social upheaval. The three-Judge bench dismissed as “far-fetched fears” the apprehension expressed by Interior Cabinet secretary, Dr Fred Matiang’i, Inspector-General, Joseph Boinett, Directorate of Criminal Investigations chief George Kinoti and Immigration boss Gordon Kihalangwa, that they were likely to be impeached over the deportation scandal. The four top civil servants were at liberty to seek the High Court’s intervention once any person or institution petitioned for their removal from office after they were found guilty of disobeying Justice Luka Kimaru’s orders requiring them to produce Miguna in court and instead deported him to Canada on February 6, the court said.
