Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Police have launched investigations into the Sunday night heist at Habib Bank AG Zurich, Koinange branch in Nairobi. They said preliminary investigations indicate the raid could be an inside job, with some bank’s staff being investigated. Nairobi Police Commander Joseph ole Tito said the amount of money stolen was not known immediately. “We have left it to the management to establish the exact figure stolen. That they managed to break into the strong room points to an inside job,” he said. The robbers accessed the bank from the rear side of the building, broke into the strong room after tampering with alarm and CCTV systems. They are said to have used gas cylinders to break into safes and had time to eat inside the banking hall. All this happened despite the bank being manned by armed security officers. Investigators recovered gas cylinder, assortment of breaking materials and cartons used to cover the glass display windows. “They had an ample time to execute their plans. They are people who knew what they were doing,” Tito told journalists. The bank manager discovered about the raid yesterday mid morning and alerted the police. Investigators recorded statements from senior bank officers as part of preliminary investigations.
