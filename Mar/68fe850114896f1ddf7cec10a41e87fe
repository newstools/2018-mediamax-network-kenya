NASA co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka has warned the Orange Democratic Movement party against pushing ahead with its plan to oust Ford-kenya leader Moses Wetang’ula as senate minority leader, warning the move will only widen the growing rifts in the troubled alliance. Kalonzo who was flanked by his co-principals Musalia Mudavadi and Wetang’ula during a series of campaign rallies for Wiper parliamentary candidate Edith Nyenze said they will talk to ODM senators and resolve the issue. Ford Kenya has dared ODM to remove Wetang’ula from the parliamentary leadership slot and asked the orange party to instead quit the coalition.
