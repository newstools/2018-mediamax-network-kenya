Women Premier League (WPL) holders Vihiga Queens travel to Nairobi to face Mathare Saturday at 11am in the only WPL match scheduled for Nairobi County this weekend. Having won three matches for nine points in as many matches, Vihiga are keen to keep the momentum in Saturday’s match and coach Alex Alumira is not expecting an easy clash. “As the defending champion, all the teams are coming strong at us and we do not expect Mathare to be any different. We will ensure we do not commit any mistakes in our defence as we go for goals,” Alumira said. Mathare are looking to atone for their loss in the last fixture where they were handed the season’s first loss by Makolander in a match that ended 2-1. After playing four matches, Mathare are ranked sixth at seven points. Vihiga are fourth after three matches. The other match scheduled Saturday will see Wadadia welcome Mombasa Olympic to Mumias Complex. The hosts are second on the standings, having played five matches and collected 10 points from three wins and a draw. On their part, Olympic have had it rough and are yet to register a win after three matches where they have managed a single goal and soaked in eight. Coach Joshua Oyoo, who is in the process of rebuilding the team after losing his key players among them Mwanahalima Adam, will hope to register his first win against the Western Kenya outfit.
