Viden Ochieng @peoplesport11 Kisumu County secondary schools boys’ hockey champions Kisumu Day are confident of defending their title when the Term One County games start on Thursday. Booker Odhiambo, coach and teacher of the Lake Region champions, believes his boys are in top form and ready to see off their opponents when they participate in the highly-competitive term one games scheduled to take place at Maseno School. Having retained the Kisumu Central Sub County crown after seeing off rivals and last year’s finalists Kisumu Boys in a mouth-watering final, Odhiambo says their challenge is to overcome a wounded side in hosts Maseno, whom they are pooled together, and Kisumu Boys to claim the title two years in a row. “We are out to make our presence felt right from the sub-county to the national level. We have prepared well and are optimistic that the trophy will be in our safe,” said Odhiambo, who hopes the combination of Markwell Mawik (Nyongi), Emmanuel Juma (lefty) and Brian Atendi will propel his side to glory. Odhiambo says his team has been working on various ways in which they can silence the threat from a resilient Maseno and Kisumu Boys who are keen to re-assert their authority in the county. “Our opponents are equally prepared for the task ahead but they must be ready for a real battle when we meet this week,” added Odhiambo. Kisumu Day kicks off their title defence against Nyando sub-county kings Otieno Oyoo before taking on Maseno and later on Nyabondo Boys in Pool B.
