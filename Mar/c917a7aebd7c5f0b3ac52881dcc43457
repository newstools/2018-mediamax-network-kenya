Suspended Kenyatta National Hospital Chief Executive Officer Lily Koros now blames procurement cartels for her woes at the referral hospital after she instituted changes that locked most of them out. The CEO who appeared before the health committee alongside the former Director of Clinical Services Dr. Bernard Githae and the hospital’s board said the orchestrated incidents coupled by staffing issues and a breakdown of the referral system in the country had adversely affected the hospital’s reputation. Meanwhile Health Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki was also taken to task by the Senate over the KNH surgery mix-up that saw a patient wrongly operated on.
