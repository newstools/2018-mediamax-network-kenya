The High Court has Friday nullified the election of Embakasi East Member of Parliament Babu Owino joining the list of 11 elected leaders who have lost their seats through election petitions. Justice Joseph Sergon who delivered the judgement ruled that  Babu’s election was marred by a litany of irregularities including statistical errors, voter bribery and intimidation. Also to loose his seat Friday was Wajir West MP Ahmed Kolosh and Turkana Women Representative Joyce Emanikor with Likoni MP Mishi Mboko and Lamu Governor Fahim Twaha surviving their petitions.
