Human rights activist Okiya Omtatah was yesterday arrested at Milimani Law court corridors following a warrant of arrest issued against him for failing to attend the hearing of a criminal case. Omtatah was charged alongside other protesters with creating disturbance on State House Road and two other counts in 2011. He was arrested by officers from Kilimani DCI office a few hours after Milimani chief magistrate Francis Andayi issued the warrant following an application by the prosecution that the accused was not present in court for the hearing of the case scheduled for yesterday. Omtatah is charged alongside Wicliff Nyakiwa and Florence Kanyua who are out on a Sh15,000 bond. The three are also accused of refusing to have their finger prints taken by police for purpose of records and identification while in custody. The activists were demonstrating to petition then President Mwai Kibaki to sack the then Education Minister Sam Ongeri over a Sh4.2 billion scandal. The case will be mentioned on March 23.
