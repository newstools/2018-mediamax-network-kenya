Two students from Mult-imedia university were Wednesday charged with attempting to obtain 100,000 shillings from former minority chief whip Jakoyo Midiwo. The duo were accused of being a part of a cartel operating within parliament buildings extorting money from politicians. The suspects were arrested for impersonating Murangâ€™a women representative Sabina Chege to defraud Midiwo.
