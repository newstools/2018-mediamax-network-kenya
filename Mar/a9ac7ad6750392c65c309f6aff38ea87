Narc-Kenya party leader has accused Kerugoya High Court judge Lucy Gitari of open bias in a petition she filed challenging the victory of Kirinyaga Governor Anne Waiguru in the August election. Karua has consequently vowed to lodge a formal protest with the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) over Lady Justice Gitari’s professional conduct. Addressing the press outside the Kerugoya court yesterday, Karua’s lawyer Gitobu Imanyara said Gitari exhibited open bias while dealing with the case “by consistently trying to sabotage the petition”. He said the judge erred by not giving directions on Monday for all applications to be heard and determined and waited for two days to give direction. Karua (pictured) said before any other matter is heard the application for Gitari to recuse herself should be determined. The petition occurs after a three-judge Appellate bench said Karua petition against Waiguru, which had been thrown out by Gitari on technicalities, should be heard afresh. However, Waiguru through lawyer Paul Nyamodi, has objected the Appellate court’s ruling, saying the period set aside for election petitions has lapsed and the matter should not be heard.
