Emmanuel Masinde @baromeo Grappling on how to come back to his best, world marathon record holder Dennis Kimetto is strategising on a winning formula in the Boston Marathon scheduled on April 16. Kimetto, who became the first athlete to break the 2:03 barrier when he set a world record time of 2:02:57 in the Berlin Marathon in 2014, is targeting at least a podium finish in Boston to kick start his career after being out of action for a long time due to a series of injuries. He, however believes he is back in shape especially after pulling out of last year’s Boston and Chicago marathons to concentrate on a good recovery plan. “I feel very strong now owing to the training I have had since last year and I am hopeful that I will make a comeback in Boston,” said Kimetto, who trains at Kapng’etuny in Elgeyo Marakwet county. Though hopeful of a victorious comeback, Kimetto reckons his performance in marathons has been waning after setting the world record but he is not losing sleep over it. “That is common in sports where one has low and high seasons. I have not done well in full marathons recently but the good thing is that my form is back and I am ready for the battle again,” he added. Kimetto made his marathon debut in Berlin in September 2012, finishing second, one second behind Geoffrey Mutai after clocking 2:04:16, the fastest debut in history on a record-eligible course. He would get his first marathon victory at the Tokyo course in February 2013, where he ran 2:06:50 to break the course record. Eight months later, Kimetto won the Chicago marathon in a course record of 2:03:45. Kimetto had his first bad marathon experience at the 2014 Boston event where he entered as one of the favourites but dropped out after 35km. He, however, made amends in emphatic fashion that September when he set the world record in Berlin before finishing third at the 2015 London marathon.
