Steve Umidha @steveumidha Communications Authority of Kenya (CA) is under renewed pressure over supposed delay in implementation of the report on dominance in the country’s telecommunications sector. Telkom Kenya is the latest industry player after Bharti Airtel to openly voice its concerns over the slow pace in the implementation of telcoms market dominance study presented to the regulator last month by British firm, MS Analysys Mason for its scrutiny and subsequent adoption. MS Analysys Mason authored the study. Board Chairman Eddy Njoroge (pictured) yesterday asked the regulator to speed up the implementation process “without fear or favour”, putting spotlight on the regulator and ICT ministry. The two have previously said they “do not intend to punish success”, which was in relation to proposals by Airtel Kenya and other mobile operators who continue to decry of Safaricom’s market dominance. “Playing field should be levelled for proper and conducive competition. The market dominance report should be able to improve the sector for other players,” Njoroge said yesterday. He was speaking during the company’s reopening of its mobile money unit, nine months after scrapping its Orange Money product for lack of meeting market standards. CA director-general Francis Wangusi, however, said the report’s implementation was uniquely dependent on the authority’s board, and that its adoption could only happen after internal audits by its staff is conducted before its recommendations are gazetted. “Anything we deem is fit to come under regulation, as regulator we will be able to execute it, the purpose of regulation is also to protect the consumer,” he said.
