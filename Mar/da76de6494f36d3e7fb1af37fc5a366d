National volleyball champions Kenya Pipeline and rivals Kenya Prisons leave the country Saturday for Egypt where they will represent the country in Women’s African Clubs Championship that will serve off on March 6 in Cairo, Egypt. Kenya Pipeline under coach Japheth Munala who are gunning for their eighth continental title named a squad of 14 Friday morning that saw the inclusion of continental championship debutants Christine Njambi and Tebla Simuyu. The side will however be without the services of middle blocker Christine Siwa who suffered an injury that will see her stay out for three months after which she will have to undergo surgery in case the injury does not heal. “We signed Siwa from KCB and we needed her for this championship but it is unfortunate the injury has put her down. We will also miss the services of Violet Makuto as she was not with the team at the time we were presenting the team two months ago,” Munala explained. The coach expressed his desire to have travelled with new signing from Soweto Girls Jemimah ‘Magereza’ Nafula but she could not secure her Visa in time as she acquired her national Identity card two days ago. Munala is confident his charges will improve their last performance on the continental stage. The side last won the continental title in 2005 and in the last edition they finished at a dismal fifth, something Munala attributes to bad luck on their part as they lost to their counterparts Kenya Prisons in the quarterfinals. In the local league, Pipeline have been the dominant side and Munala says it’s time they recaptured their lost glory continentally. – LYNETTE MATHEKA
