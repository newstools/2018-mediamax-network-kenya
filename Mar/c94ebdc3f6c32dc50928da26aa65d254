President Uhuru Kenyatta has once again issued a stern warning  to public officers against engaging in graft as he seeks to stamp his authority over the vice and secure his legacy during the 2nd and final term in office. Speaking when he presided over the swearing-in ceremony of newly appointed principal secretaries and chief administrative secretaries and principal secretaries the president said his administration will not tolerate  any officer abusing the integrity of the offices they hold. The warning coming just two days after the president told accounting officers that anyone found guilty of pilferage and wastage of public funds will be subjected to the full force of the law.
