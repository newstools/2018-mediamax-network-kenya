Steve Umidha @steveumidha Petrol prices will from today drop by Sh0.46 per litre in Nairobi while diesel price goes up by Sh0.90, in the latest review by energy regulator. The marginal drop means that motorists in Nairobi will pay Sh107.46 per litre of super petrol from Sh107.92, the first decline in seven months while diesel pump price will cost Sh97.86 higher from Sh96.96 as well as kerosene which also rose by Sh0.70 to Sh77.45 per litre in the city. The Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) attributed the review changes in this month’s prices to the decrease in average landed cost of imported super petrol by 1.26 per cent from $688.76 (Sh69730.75) per tonne in January this year to $680.05 (Sh68848.94) per tonne in February, in a period that also saw diesel prices increase by 4.22 per cent from $593.45 (Sh60081.47) per tonne to $618.49 (Sh62616.55) per tonne. Kerosene rose by 3.45 per cent from $645.72 (Sh65373.34) per ton to $668 (Sh67628.99) per tonne. “The purpose of the fuel pricing regulations is to cap the pump prices of the products which are already in the country, so that the importation and other prudently incurred costs are recovered, while ensuring reasonable prices to consumers,” ERC said in a statement. Kenyan consumers have in recent months bore the brunt of high fuel prices despite the commodity’s global surge, with the International Energy Agency (IEA) last month saying the demand for oil could go up this year, even as major world countries like US continue to exploit its shale oil. The US oil exploitation, economists say could surpass Saudi Arabia and Russia as the world’s top oil producers. Kenyans will in the meantime wait until April 14 before another review by the commission, with previous demands asking for a favoUrably fuel prices to reflect on the growing economy.
