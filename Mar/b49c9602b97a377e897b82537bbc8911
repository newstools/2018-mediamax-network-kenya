A legal battle surrounding the procurement of Sh1.9 billion ferries from Turkey by Kenya Ferry Services (KFS) has now moved to the Court of Appeal. KFS, through lawyer Nani Mungai, told appellate judges Martha Koome, Wanjiru Karanja and Alnassir Visram that High Court’s move to stop the construction of MV Safari had caused a transport crisis at the Likoni crossing channel because of the frequent breakdown of the other two old ferries. Last year, the court stopped KFS from re-advertising supervision and inspection services for two new vessels that were set to operate at the Likoni channel over safety issues raised by Bonriz Insurance Marine Surveyors. “If the orders remain in place, taxpayers’ money will go to waste since the construction will not take place despite KFS having paid an extra amount,” said the lawyer. He termed malicious claims by Bonrize that one of the new ferries MV Jambo had defects. “The firm wants the court to force KFS to validate the cancelled contract and allow it to do the job,” said Mungai. The court will rule on the matter on April 26.
