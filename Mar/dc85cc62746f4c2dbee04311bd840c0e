The government is seemingly walking the talk of clamping down on individuals who are encroaching on land meant for sports development. Sports Cabinet Secretary Rashid Mohammed Echesa yesterday witnessed first-hand where unscrupulous people were planning to develop such a land and warned the individuals involved of dire consequences. Echesa made an impromptu visit at a site near the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Goal Project after word went round that a developer had encroached on the area with a view to constructing residential houses. “I gathered that some people were trying to invade the land and we have left the matter to the police and personnel from the ministry to ensure that does not happen. This is a government land and we will also ensure that it is fenced to ward off intruders,” said Echesa. The CS made the remarks moments after leading an inspection tour of Kasarani which is currently undergoing refurbishment. Echesa said he had already talked to the contractor and agreed that repairs will be complete in one month. “Kasarani will be complete in a month’s time and we will soon compile a report that we will disseminate to the public to inform them on the state of the project,” he added. Echesa says the ministry is duty-bound to adhere to the time-frame set by the government to complete construction works in other stadia such as Nyayo, Kinoru (Meru) and Kipchoge Keino (Eldoret). He had earlier on presided over the Kenya Academy of Sports (KAS) strategic plan geared at nurturing talents countrywide in conjunction with the national and county government. Echesa hinted that the government will embark on a deliberate policy to roll out sports academies that shall encompass all sporting disciplines in the country in a bid to tap inherent talent. “The government will partner with the KAS and the county government towards this noble course. I will be having a consultative meeting with governors to discuss how best to implement the programmes,” said Echesa.
