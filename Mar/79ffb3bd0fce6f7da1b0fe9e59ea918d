Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua Friday urged the Kerugoya High Court judge Lucy Gitari to step down from hearing an election petition she has filed against the Kirinyaga County Governor Anne Waiguru. Karua accused Lady Justice Gitari of bias in handling the matter and urged her to disqualify herself with immediate effect. Through lawyer Gitobu Imanyara, Karua argued that the same judge dismissed the petition on November 15 before it was heard and determined and she should not handle it again. “I moved to an appeals court after you struck out my petition before it was heard. The appeal court then ordered the petition be heard afresh and it is only fair that you should not hear it,” said Karua. The petitioner accused Justice Gitari of having a “fixed mind” and expressed fear she will not do justice to her. “When you first made a ruling on my petition you used disparaging words. There was use of unnecessary strong language, demonstrating you had a fixed mind. Therefore, I’m here to urge for a recuse. The petition should be heard by another judge for me to get a fair hearing,” said Karua. Karua provided 16 grounds which she said clearly proves the presiding judge ought to recuse herself before the matter goes to full hearing. However, Waiguru dismissed the application by Karua as baseless and urged the court to dismiss it with costs. Through lawyer Paul Nyamondi, Waiguru said she had full confidence in Justice Gitari and told her not to step down from hearing the petition. Justice Gitari said she will make her ruling on Ms Karua’s application on April 6.
