Education Cabinet secretary Ambassador Amina Mohamed (pictured) has asked university student leaders to use all available means in addressing problems that learners face instead of mounting demonstrations on the streets. She spoke when she met student leaders from more than 16 public and private universities in her office yesterday. Earlier, Strathmore University Student Council chairman Alex Ndegwa, who presented a memorandum to the CS, said disruptions of academic programmes through strikes, demonstrations and consequent closures of the universities was affecting students negatively. Amina underscored the need to find different ways of resolving conflicts, without disrupting normal academic programmes or causing harm to life. She said the ministry would have regular consultative meetings with university administrations with a view to maintaining harmony and stability necessary for teaching and learning. Amina pledged to hold biennial meetings with university student leaders with a view to strengthening the trust between the administration and students.
