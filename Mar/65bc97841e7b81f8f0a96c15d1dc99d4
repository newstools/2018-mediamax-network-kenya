The government now says minor hiccups experienced in the launch of the new curriculum including reported grammatical and factual errors in some of the textbooks will not be allowed to sabotage the initiative. Education Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohammed says that the ministry will not back track on its text book policy and that teachers should address the minor issues. Amina who launched the national dialogue on the state of education in the country at the Maasai Mara University in Narok county further said that teacher training for the second phase of piloting of the new competency based curriculum should be up and rolling with a sensitisation programme expected to be conducted soon.
