Bernard Gitau @benagitau The Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) chief executive position is vacant after the expiry of Halakhe Waqo’s six-year non-renewable contract. In an advertisement, EACC called on  interested and qualified candidates to apply for the position by October 30. “The Commission invites applications from suitably qualified persons to fill the position of; Secretary to the Commission established under article 250 (12) of the Constitution,” read the statement in part. Waqo’s term expires in three months  after serving for six years in line with the EACC Act. EACC added that the successful candidate will be appointed for a six-year non-renewable term where remuneration terms and conditions apply, as determined by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). As he prepares to exit, Waqo has highlighted milestones the commission has achieved during his tenure which include arrests and prosecutions of senior government officials implicated in graft. “Such arrests and prosecutions have led to hefty fines amounting to millions of shillings and mandatory jail terms which has sent a strong message that being corrupt has dire consequences,” said Waqo. He added that since 2013, the Commission completed 130 cases in courts leading to 67 convictions, 36 acquittals and 27 withdrawals. “In 2017/18 financial year, the Commission recorded an impressive 49 completed cases in court resulting in 39 convictions and 10 acquittals,” he said. Waqo said the war against corruption has bore fruit because of cooperation in the criminal justice system. “We hope the cooperation will achieve 100 per cent conviction rate in the near future,” he said.
