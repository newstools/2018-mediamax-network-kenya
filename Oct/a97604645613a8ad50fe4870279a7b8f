A non-governmental organisation has launched a tree planting sensitisation campaign amongst schooling populations in a bid to boost a culture of environmental conservation in line with the world’s sustainable development goal of management of climate change. This comes at the time when many parts of the country are receiving showers, thanks to the short rainy season, with kenyans urged to take up the challenge and plant more trees. Me-forest is partnering with secondary school students to plant over 100 million  trees annually in order to contribute to at least 1%of national tree planting objectives. Speaking during the exercise launch at Lukenya in Machakos County, Me-forest director Joe Kithyaka said the project has stretched to 5 counties , and is considered a game changer initiative aimed at fostering a culture of environmental conservation  among the young people.
