The Kenya Publishers Association has dismissed images circulating on social media negatively depicting  some of the books being used under the new curriculum and have instead claimed a smear campaign designed to damage their reputation. The publishers also say excerpts of books being circulated on social media, were misleading as they have been taken out of context —this as some of the excerpts were proved to be from Ghana and the United States.
