More than 500 former workers of the  East Africa Portland Cement company (EAPCC) are up in arms over allegations of unpaid dues amounting to sh 1.5billion. The agitated former workers whose contracts were terminated four months ago, are yet to receive their dues despite of a court ruling, ordering the giant cement manufacturing company to pay them with immediate effect. According to the demonstrators who faced off with security agencies at the plant, paralyzing operations, the company management has failed to comply with the court order and is allegedly intimidating the workers leaders to frustrate strike attempts.
