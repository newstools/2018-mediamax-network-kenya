James MomanyiÂ @jamomanyi National Treasury yesterday failed to account for billions of shillings collected from betting, lotteries and gaming that was supposed to be deposited in National Sports Fund (NSF) since January this year when it was put into operation. National Treasury Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Nelson Gaichuhie told the National Assembly Committee on Finance and National Planning that while Sh3.4 billion was collected in the financial year 2017/18 from betting, lotteries and gaming taxes, the money was sent to the Treasury instead of the NSF account for the development of sports and recreational activities. Further, he said the Treasury has opened a holding account where they have deposited Sh396 million out of the Sh1.98 billion collected this financial year from July. The Treasury, Gaichuhie said, will deposit the remaining amount once Parliament passes the Sports (Amendment) Bill 2018, which according to him is set to align NSF to the Public Finance Management Act. He said the Sh3.4 billion in the last financial year was sent to the exchequer because there was no framework yet in place on the management of NSF. However, nominated MP Geoffrey Otsosi, who raised the question, termed the response unsatisfactory. He said when Ministry of Sports Principal Secretary appeared before the National Assembly Committee on Implementation he told members that the fund was put into operation in January and that they had even recruited a chief executive officer and members of staff to manage the fund.
