After his frenzy relationships that started with Akothee, singer Brown Mauzo has called it quits when it comes to relationships if he won’t get Wema Sepetu. Mauzo who is said to have exiled himself to TZ for more than a year after allegedly impregnating his manager’s wife, is ready to risk it all with the Tanzanian actress. “I know I have not been lucky when it comes to relationships, but I believe if she gives me the chance, I will prove the naysayers wrong. I love Wema and that is not a secret. My latest song Killing Me is dedicated to her. If things don’t work out for us, then I am ready to remain a bachelor until the very end,” he told PD Wikendi. Mauzo, who was signed by TZ’s superstar Ali Kiba, stated that he is planning to unveil his management as well as release his forthcoming album, which he says will surprise his fans.
