The high court has ordered suspects Jacque Maribe and her Fiancé Joseph Irungu detained until Monday after a mental assessment was ordered for the television journalist. Maribe will undergo the test at Mathari Hospital in Nairobi. Justice Jessi Lessit said the suspect cannot be called upon to take plea without a mental examination. Meanwhile Bryan Kassaine Spira, the best of friend of Mr Joseph Irungu ‘Jowie’ and TV anchor Jacque Maribe, has turned state witness, according to the nation’s law enforcement sources.
