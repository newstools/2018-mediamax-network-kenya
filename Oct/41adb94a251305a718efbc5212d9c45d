Mercy Mwai @wangumarci A Senate committee has now summoned Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria to appear before it next week Tuesday over the ongoing water crisis in Murang’a and Nairobi counties. The committee on Lands accused Wa Iria of arrogance for snubbing various invitations to shed light on the matter. Chairperson Githiomi Mwangi said they want the governor to explain his stand over the standoff that has seen him and Murang’a Water and Sewerage Company (Muwasco) engage in a war of words, thus paralysing water supply in the two counties. “We don’t take it kindly that he decided to snub the invite much as he refused to send apologies for his no show. This is arrogance of the highest order,” he said. Githiomi was categorical that water is a national resource that should be shared by all. “Water cannot be owned by an organisation or an individual. We don’t expect that residents of Murang’a can be denied the commodity because of politics the same way Nairobi residents risk being disconnected by an individual.” The row, which has been in court twice, started when Wa Iria declared intention to take over the water companies in Murang’a, saying water supply is a devolved function. He also accused management of the water firms in Murang’a of embezzling funds.
