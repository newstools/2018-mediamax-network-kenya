Nakuru County government has questioned the sale of more than 3,000 acres of land to KenGen by the controversial Ng’ati land buying company. The county has formed a committee to investigate the land sale done three years ago without the involvement of members of the land buying society. “We have formed a committee to prepare a report and the way forward before we meet the Head of State,” he said. This came as some members of the land society from Maella, Naivasha, called for fresh sub-division of the land and cancellation of the KenGen sale during a meeting held at the Naivasha sub-county offices that was chaired by Governor Lee Kinyanjui over the  land issues. Stakeholders claimed since the land dispute started more than 20 years ago, 60 people had been killed, tens injured and property worth millions of shillings destroyed. Naivasha MP Jane Kihara said wrangles over land and society leadership had affected development plans in the area while KenGen property manager Jennifer Odour said the company followed the legal process to acquire the land that has high geothermal energy potential.
