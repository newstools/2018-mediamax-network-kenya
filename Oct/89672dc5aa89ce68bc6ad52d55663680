The Evangelical Alliance of Kenya (EAK) has added its voice to the referendum calls, saying there is need for a proper audit of certain articles in the current constitution. Addressing the press at their Nairobi offices on Wednesday, EAK chairman Mark Kariuki said any referendum should be informed by what Kenyans want and not on what politicians want for themselves.
