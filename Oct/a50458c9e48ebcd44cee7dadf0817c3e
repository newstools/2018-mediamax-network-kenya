James Momanyi @jamomanyi Kenya has been ranked fourth in Africa and position 94 globally in a new Human Capital Index report launched last week by the World Bank in Bali, Indonesia. Kenya was beaten by Seychelles which was ranked position 43 globally with a score of 0.65; Mauritius at 52 with a score of 0.60 and Algeria at 93 with a tie score of 0.52 – matching that of Kenya. The index ranges between 0 and 1. The launch of the index was held during the International Monetary Fund/World Bank annual meeting and the Kenyan delegation included Treasury Cabinet secretary  Henry Rotich, principal secretary Kamau Thugge and Central Bank of Kenya governor Patrick Njoroge. The one-week meeting also reviewed the global economic performance and highlighted emerging challenges especially the rising oil prices, a normalisation of monetary policy in advanced economies and the potential escalation of trade restrictions. The index, which is a measure of productivity of the next generation of workers relative to the benchmark of complete education and full health, ranked 157 countries based on their health and education outcomes and their impact on productivity. Except for Algeria, Mauritius and Seychelles, Kenya ranked position one when compared among the large economies like South Africa and Nigeria in sub-Saharan Africa. The 0.52 score on the Human Capital Index means that that the expected productivity, as a future worker, of a child born today in Kenya (provided all indicators remain constant) is 52 per cent of what it could be with complete education and full health.
