 Police in Kapsabet in Nandi county have  established that  a female  accountant whose body  was discovered at a hotel room in Eldoret town had been battling depression for sometime and had not reported to work for more than six months. The late Stella Chepkoech is said to have on several occasions threatened  to commit suicide after allegedly falling out with the father of her 6months old baby when she discovered he was married to another woman. Preliminary investigations have however ruled out any links to an ongoing audit by the Ethics And Anti-Corruption Commission at the Nandi county government which has so far seen two other officials commit suicide while citing frustrations.
