Governor Paul Chepkwony said his government has also waived all mortuary charges for the bodies of victims that are lying at the county facility. In a press statement,  he said the county referral hospital, where most survivors are recuperating is in dire need of blood, adding that a blood donation centre has been set up. Chepkwony said a child,  six women and nine men were among survivors admitted for treatment at the facility. He said a call centre and an information desk with Red Cross counsellors had also been set up at the referral hospital to support families of the accident victims identify bodies of their kin.
