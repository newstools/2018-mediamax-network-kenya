Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe Lake region governors have  asked the  National government to reduce bureaucratic bottlenecks that allegedly hinder counties from accessing investors. Speaking during the Lake Region Trade Investment and Blue Economy Conference in Bomet, the governors  said counties cannot develop unless they interact directly with private investors to exploit economic opportunities. Led by Kericho’s Paul Chepkwony, the governors said many of them have secured investments from aboard but the investors are unable to access their counties because of  government bureaucracy. Attract investment “It has been difficult to attract investment in Kenya especially through  the public-private partnership. There are 21 processes that must be adhered to and this can take even up to six years, a move that has seen most of us lose many investors,” said Chepkwony. Chepkwony was among the panelists who included Cabinet secretaries Eugene Wamalwa (Devolution), Ken Obura (East African Community) Ababu Namwamba (Foreign Affairs CAS) and  Kisumu Governor Anyang Nyong’o. Wamalwa said his ministry is working on a policy and legal framework on Lake Region Economic Bloc which may be complete by end of January.
