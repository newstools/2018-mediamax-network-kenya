Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Uasin Gishu Governor Jackson Mandago has unearthed a major land-related scam being perpetrated by unscrupulous land dealers in cahoots with disgruntled Lands ministry officials. Addressing the press in Eldoret town, he said the dealers  were identifying idle government land in Eldoret town and its environs and colluding with ministry officials to sub-divide and sell it to unsuspecting investors. “We are receiving several multi-million-shilling fraud transaction cases every week, involving National and County government  property,” he said. Mandago (pictured) warned local and foreign investors against purchasing prime land in the outskirts of the town, whose ownership and documents are shrouded in mystery. He also urged the national government to address the issue and weed out “massive corruption” in the Lands sector. The governor asked Lands Cabinet secretary Faridah Karoney to act fast and digitise land transactions in the counties to end the rot and improve service delivery in the ministry. He said 233 illegal title deeds for public property in the area have been revoked following concerted efforts to reclaim public spaces.
