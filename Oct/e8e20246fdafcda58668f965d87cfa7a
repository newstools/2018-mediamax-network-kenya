Migori Governor Okoth Obado has been freed on a KShs 5 million bail. The governor is also expected to pay two sureties of a similar amount. In a ruling delivered by High Court Judge Jessie Lesiit on Wednesday, the governor who has spent close to a month at a remand prison in Nairobi was further ordered to deposit his travel documents including passports. Obado is facing two murder charges alongside his personal assistant Michael Oyamo and County Clerk Caspal Obiero. The two co-accused will however remain in custody after being denied bail. Obado has been behind bars at the Industrial Area Remand Prison since his arrest on September 21 in connection with the murder of Sharon Otieno.
