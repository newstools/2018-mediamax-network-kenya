Nairobi, Monday @PeopleSports11 World 3,000m steeplechase record holder and Commonwealth Games silver medallist Beatrice Chepkoech has been shortlisted among the 10 nominees for the IAAF Female World Athlete of the Year award. Chepkoech shaved eight seconds off the steeplechase World Record at the Monaco leg of the IAAF Diamond League, running eight minutes, 44.32 seconds to cap off her wonderful season. The 27-year-old set the new record, recently ratified by the IAAF, just after winning silver at the Commonweal Games in Gold Coast Australia, running in the 1,500m. She also had a super season at the Diamond League, winning seven of the eight races in the circuit. Chepkoech also won the African title at the Senior Athletics Championship in Asaba, Nigeria, before heading to the Continental Cup in Ostrava where she also picked the crown. She will vie for the prestigious award alongside South Africa’s Caster Semenya, British sprinter Dina-Asher Smith and heptathlete Naffi Thiam among others. A three-way voting process will determine the finalists. The IAAF Council and the IAAF Family will cast their votes by email, while fans can vote online via the IAAF’s social media platforms. Individual graphics for each nominee will be posted on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram this week; a ‘like’ on Facebook and Instagram or a retweet on Twitter will count as one vote. The IAAF Council’s vote will count for 50 per cent of the result, while the IAAF Family’s votes and the public votes will each count for 25 per cent of the final result.  Voting for the Female World Athlete of the Year closes on 12 November. At the conclusion of the voting process, five men and as many women finalists will be announced by the IAAF. -CAPITAL SPORTS
