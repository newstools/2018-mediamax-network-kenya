Amina who was attending a consultative meeting of the competency based curriculum with members of the National Steering Committee said the roll out process is way beyond international set standards, this even as several stake holders continue to raise red flags over the country’s preparedness in rolling out the competency based curriculum. Amina has in the meantime said this year’s examination is well on course, warning schools against plotting on engaging in exam cheating.
