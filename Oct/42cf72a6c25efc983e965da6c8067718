A stray leopard is reported to have killed 10 sheep belonging to a woman in Mutahaciu village in Murangâ€™a county. The villagers claim this is not the first time such an incident has occurred, saying they are yet to receive compensation from the Kenya Wildlife Service. Locals however have been urged to be on the lookout for the stray animal which is still at large and report any such incident to the relevant authorities.
