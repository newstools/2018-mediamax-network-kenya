Teachers in West Pokot county have threatened to go on strike and paralyze the KCSE and KCPE examinations if a meeting  with the Teachers Service Commission scheduled for 17th of this month fails to bear fruits. KNUT West Pokot branch secretary Martin Sembelo  accused the Teachers Service Commission of failing to honour its pledge to reverse the delocalization policy as directed by the president.
