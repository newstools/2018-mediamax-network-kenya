AFC Leopards have confirmed acquisition of a new coach in Serbian Nicola Kavazovic to replace Rodolfo Zapata from Argentina. Nicola, who is the immediate former coach of Botswana champions Township Rollers, was one of the three coaches who had been shortlisted for the Ingwe job from a large pool of 20 applicants. Speaking at a press conference at the weekend, Leopards secretary Oscar Igaida (above) said the team’s executive believes Nicola is the man suited for the job due to his vast experience. “We did a lot of head-hunting for coaches both locally and internationally and decided that Nicola was the one who had better credentials and hopefully, he should unravel the mystery of Leopards dwindling fortunes in the Sport Pesa Premier League,” said Igaida. Flanked by organising secretary Timothy Lilumbi and treasurer Oliver Imbenzi, Igaida warned persons purporting to be Leopards officials to keep off the club and stated that the new coach will have a free hand in selecting players of his choice. Already, Nicola has identified three foreign players who he has have recommended to be drafted in the team and has also been monitoring several SPL players with a view to giving them a chance to don the Ingwe jersey. Kavazovic started coaching job in 1996 in BASK, Belgrade, as youth coach. Besides BASK, Kavazovic worked as youth and senior coach in BSK, Zarkovo, Borac and Resnik. In 1998, Kavazovic, who is a graduate of Belgrade Sports University, was voted as the  youngest high educated football coach in SR Yugoslavia.
