Since putting pen-to-paper committing to work with Tanzania’s finest, Ali Kiba, Kenyan singer Brown Mauzo has been making huge music strides, despite taking a prolonged hiatus. After the long break, he is back with another love song, Killing Me, where he sings about his lover. It has been rumoured the lover he’s singing about in the song is popular Tanzanian actress and screen siren, Wema Sepetu. Killing Me is one of those soft bongo flava jams with a touch of R&B and Mauzo’s vocals does great justice to the Abba-produced track. The video was directed by Kenny and it’s clear from its quality that some serious thoughts were invested in it; some good cash too. “There is nothing like love; it is a feeling one cannot ignore and in this song, I am just expressing my feelings. If you meet the right person, even her smile is enough communication. I also praise the beauty of African queens. They are blessed in every way,” Mauzo told Spice. The jam goes with a rating of 6.5/10.
