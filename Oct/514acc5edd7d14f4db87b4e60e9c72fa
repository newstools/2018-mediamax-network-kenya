A section of MPs allied to the Jubilee coalition have called on the ODM supremo  Raila Odinga to now focus on continental politics and leave local politics to local leaders. Raila was appointed Africa’s High representative on Infrastructure and Development by the African Union. The leaders say Raila has now joined the club of African statesmen and should therefore avoid engaging in cheap local politics . However Odinga’s confidant’s including Senator James Orengo have dismissed calls to have Odinga quit local politics saying Odinga will remain active in local politics despite his continental duties.
