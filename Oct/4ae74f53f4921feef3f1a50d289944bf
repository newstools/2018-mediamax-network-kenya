Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) must be reconstituted afresh before the issue of referendum is agreed upon, Kieni MP Kanini Kega has said. He said Kenyans have no faith in the institution and therefore it cannot be allowed to conduct any other election. The legislator however said the referendum is an inevitable exercise that would help reduce the country’s ballooning wage bill and tax burden of the common man. “It is foolish to imagine that you can wake up one morning and propose to reduce counties from 47 to 12, while Kenyans still have no faith in the body charged with the duty of carrying out the exercise,” he stated. Kanini made the remarks while addressing journalists in Mombasa where he said there is need to scrap some constituencies for effective service delivery and administration. The lawmaker argued that the outcome of a population census to be carried out next year would help decide which of them  to reduce.
