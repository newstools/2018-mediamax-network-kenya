Sports Cabinet secretary Rashid Achesa faces arrest for snubbing police summons over links to Kakamega Senator Cleophas Malala “photoshopped nude” photos circulating on social media. On Friday,  detectives at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) Police Station waited for the minister but he did not show up. He had been directed to appear at the station at 10 am without fail. Malala has accused  his political rival, Achesa, of masterminding the scheme by procuring the services of three journalists —  David Ndolo, Alex Njue and Stanford Ondego — to create and circulate the photos, which depict him in a compromising situation with an unidentified woman. By Friday evening, no correspondence from the CS or from his lawyer had been delivered explaining his failure to show up. A spot check by the People Daily at his office at Kencom House revealed he was not in the office for the better part of the day. Meanwhile, chief magistrate Francis Andai  has discharged the three journalists after the court ruled sections of the law under which they were to be charged with were suspended by the High Court. In May, High Court judge Enoch Chacha Mwita temporarily suspended 23 sections of the Computer Misuse and Cyber Crime Act pending the hearing and determination of a case filed by bloggers.
