Kenya Football Fans Association (KEFOFA) has received an interim certificate of registration. The registration certificate, handed to the association chairman Francis Liboyi, gives them a chance to further their scope in the country and open branches that will in turn boost their membership numbers across the country. Following the move by Rose Wasike, the Registrar of Sports, the Liboyi-led committee that was elected at a Special General Meeting (SGM) as per the laid down law, the association can now venture into more meaningful affiliations including legal matters on its members and their activities. Yesterday, Liboyi told People Sport that they will now be focussing their activities in an enhanced drive that will boost their numbers on the database that currently holds slightly over 1,000 members. “We are happy that the long journey that we started in 2011 has finally materialised with this certificate. It is one thing that gives us, the officials pride or honour and place that we are the legitimate holders of the office of an association that will change the way sports fans in this country. I believe that this is the right time for us to bring in many members to our fold,” said Liboyi. Liboyi at the same time said that they are reaching out to fans across the country to play a role in supporting the national team Harambee Stars in their bid to qualify next year’s African Nations Cup finals. He said that as an affiliate African body COSAU, they expect more support from well-wishers and corporate bodies to help.
