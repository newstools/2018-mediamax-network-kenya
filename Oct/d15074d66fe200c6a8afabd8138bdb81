Clement Kamau Kiambu Governor Ferdinand Waititu has been asked to keep off the management  of Githunguri Dairy Farmers Society. More than 24,000 members of the society, which processes Fresha milk, among other products,  accused Waititu (pictured) of politicising cooperative unions in the county. Speaking at Githunguri Stadium during the society’s annual general meeting (AGM) on Saturday, the members said they have confidence in their board of management and nobody should dictate to them on how they should run their property. They faulted the county government for enacting a bill seeking to have all members of sacco boards of management serve a mandatory six-year term and leave office regardless of any outstanding leadership acumen. The current chairman Charles Ndichu has been the society’s boss for 18 years Waititu recently said the law was aimed at rooting out officials who cling to power after running down societies.
