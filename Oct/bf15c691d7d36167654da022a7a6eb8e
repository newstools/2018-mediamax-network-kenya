National boxing titans Kenya Police ‘Chafua Chafu’ withdrew from the final leg of the Boxing Association of Kenya (BAK) league at Mombasa’s Uwanja wa Mbuzi arena Friday afternoon. The move by the Kenya boxing champions immediately threw the association into a quagmire as other teams joined in the pull out frenzy without offering any reasons or notice for the unprecedented move. The withdrawals have sparked outrage from the boxing governing body that has warned it will institute a tough disciplinary action against Police for also failing to return the 2017 trophy they were stripped off by the boxing council for cheating. Outgoing BAK president John Kameta Friday warned that the association will not tolerate indiscpline showed by the police team and will seek directions from the tribunal including seeking a ban from participating in the next year’s events. “Police pulled out in the last minute without any notice, They have also failed to hand over the trophy to us to deliver it to the real Champions that is KDF, this is indiscipline of the highest order that we will not entertain. We are going to the tribunal and ask them to be banned from participating,” Kameta told Wikendi Sport. Kenya Police, main challengers of the defending champion’s narrowly won the 2017 title at Uwanja wa Mbuzi but was later stripped of the title and handed over to KDF after a decision from the association’s National Executive Committee (NEC). The law enforcers were declared league champions last year with 103 points, a point ahead of KDF but BAK reverted the win. “They are saying its lack of funds but I know they are ashamed of what they did last season,” said Kameta. Defending champions Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) boxers are set to unleash their potential despite the fact that they are the favourites after withdrawal of top challengers Police.
