Several traders and retail outlets were Thursday caught unawares after the Nairobi county government  conducted an impromptu inspection to ensure compliance with the government’s directive to lower the cost maize flour. During the swoop, several outlets were found  to be selling a 2kg packet of flour way above the stipulated price of 75 Shs.
