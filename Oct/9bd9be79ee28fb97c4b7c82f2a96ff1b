Fans of Afro-smooth music were treated to a night of fun as James Jozee, the founder of the renowned Gogosimo Band, officially launched his solo 14-track album titled Hatua at Alliance Française in Nairobi. The producer, composer, arranger, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist dropped a thrilling show much to the excitement of hundreds of his adoring fans. Jozee — an avid keytar player — led the strong seven-member band to a rapturous performance, as he belted his rich coastal sound mixed with exquisite western instrumentation and a tasty touch of African beats. He took to the stage at 8pm and serenaded revelers with some of the songs from his new album including Mwerevu, Groove to the Moon, Kivulivuli, Vanga, Sama Sama and One of a Kind. He also gave his son, Alfa Jason, an opportunity to sing his own renditions. To show support for Jozee at the event were musicians Mr Lenny and Amos and Josh and legendary dancer Kanda King, among others.
