Bernard Gitau @benagitau A lobby group has written to the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to probe Kiambu County Assembly Speaker over alleged fraud, nepotism and abuse of office. According to Active Citizens director James Waigi, Kiambu Speaker Stephen Ndicho last year carried a direct procurement to hire motor vehicle for his official use in total disregard of the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act. After the procurement officers failed to sign for the payment of Sh1.9 million for a Toyota Prado, Waigi claims the Speaker has continued to threaten and coerce them. “To secure this fraudulent payment, the Speaker wrote a private and personal letter to Parliamentary Service Commission requesting for a specific officer to be seconded to be assembly clerk and there was no such vacancy,” part of the letter read. Waigi added that on July 10, Clerk  John Mwiyithi was forced to hand over office to a stranger by the Speaker and proceed on leave. The Speaker has also been accused of employing his daughter Njoki Ndicho in the Assembly Service Board as the Personal Assistant without declaring conflict of interest. Waigi claims the said officer does not report to work besides receiving monthly salary plus other allowances. There are also claims the Speaker presented forged academic certificates while applying for the position. Waigi claims the unprocedural removal of the Clerk by the Speaker contravenes  Section 13 of the County Governments Act.
