Mercy MwaiÂ @wangumarci At least 28 containers being held at the port of Mombasa are currently under investigations by the Director of Criminal Investigations, the government revealed yesterday. Consequently, another 17 containers are yet to be claimed by the real owners and are thus still lying at the port waiting for clearance. The government said the 17 containers are held because the importer is aware what is in them is not what was declared initially. The Ministry of Trade, Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) and the multi-agency team that is fighting counterfeit goods in the country, yesterday told Members of Parliament that the containers have issues which have to be resolved before they are cleared. The 28 are part of 483 containers that the Nairobi Importers and Traders Association has been engaging the agency to have them released. According to the multi-agency team, as at October 17, 101 containers had been released and removed by the owners, six containers have been cleared but are yet to be evacuated by owners, 20 are in the process of clearance while 35 have been declared but are yet to be paid for. Appearing before the Departmental Committee on Trade, KRA Director General John Njiraini, Deputy head of public service who is leading the multi-agency team in fighting counterfeit Wanyama Musiambo and Industrialisation principal secretary Betty Maina denied claims that the government had knowingly refused to release the goods.
