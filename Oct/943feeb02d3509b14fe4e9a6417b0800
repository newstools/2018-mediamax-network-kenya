World Half Marathon Championships silver medallist Abraham Cheroben will start as favourite at the Media Maratón de Valencia Trinidad Alfonso, an IAAF Gold Label Road Race, on Sunday. In addition to that accolade achieved in the same Spanish city last March, the 25-year-old Bahraini took top honours at this race in 2014, 2015 and 2017 and set the race record of 58:48 during his first victory. Although Cherono has not produced a standout performance since his silver medal in last year’s World Championships race when he finished second to Geoffrey Kamworor, he should be tipped as the man to beat. But he’ll face the toughest field ever assembled in Valencia as no less than 17 men have broken the 60-minute barrier at least once in their careers. Kenya’s Mangata Ndiwa will be a dangerous outsider since his successful debut over the distance in April when he clocked 59:07. The same goes for Abraham Kiptum, the second fastest entrant this season after his 59:09 runner-up finish in Copenhagen where he ran five seconds faster than Ethiopia’s Jemal Yimer, who clocked 59:00 earlier this year at the RAK Half. The 22-year-old was just two seconds shy of a podium finish at the World Championships here and will gunning for a top-three finish this time round. Yimer will have compatriot Getaneh Molla for company. A notable fifth at the World Championhips, the 24-year-old has successfully combined road and track events this season, most recently with a 12:59.58 in 5000m personal best in Brussels last August. Last year’s contest witnessed a world record performance by Joyciline Jepkorir who clocked 1:04:51. Valencia organisers had lured Fancy Chemutai, who gave the world record a scare earlier this year, but she was forced to withdraw due to injury earlier this week. – IAAF
