Rodgers Ndegwa @NdegwaRodgers Seven lucky winners shared equally the midweek Sportpesa jackpot of Sh57,717,933 with each getting a whopping Sh8,245,419 after correctly predicting the outcome of 13 games. The six men and one lady were presented with their cheques yesterday at a Nairobi hotel and could not hide their joy of becoming the latest millionaires in town. The 30-year-old Florence Mukami who hails from Kiambu County, Banana region was the only lady in the group of the seven winners and noted she was lucky to have won using only a hundred bob to place the bet. “I joined the country’s leading betting platform in 2016 after being introduced by my younger brother and since then I haven’t looked back. I have been winning but the Sh8 million was my highest amount to clinch using only a hundred bob. At first my husband was not pleased with my betting habits but with time he came to understand,” quipped Mukami who is a mother of two. She added, “Actually, it’s quite funny because my husband now bets with me and in this midweek jackpot he luckily won the bonus. I am going to use this newly-acquired wealth to finish some building projects that I had started and also build rental houses,” The six, Richard Kwanga from Kisii County, Elphas Sula from Kakamega County, Reuben Kahindi from Kilifi County, Robert Rono, Barnabas Kithia and Jali from Bomet and Kitui and Mombasa counties respectively also received their cheques.
