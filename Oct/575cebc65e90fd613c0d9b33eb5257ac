Bernard Gitau and Mercy Salisi @PeopleDailyKe The Nairobi county government has banned Early Childhood Development Education (ECDE) graduation ceremonies in public ECDE centres, saying they are a burden on parents. County Executive Committee Member for Education Janet Ouko says parent could be paying a whopping Sh10 million for the graduation ceremonies. “We have noted with concern that schools are planning ECDE graduation ceremonies and charging parents between Sh1,000 and Sh1,500. This is against the spirit of free ECDE which the county is implementing. We have, therefore, issued a ban on the ceremonies especially if they attract a charge to the parents,” said Ouko. Ouko said this is part of measures to ensure ECDE in all public schools is completely free. “Parents who are burdened by hard economic times should not be exposed to other funny charges,” said Ouko. On the county measures to improve and upgrade the ECD centres, Ouko said Governor Mike Sonko administration has set aside Sh 58.6 million. “We have set aside capitation of Sh 3200 per pupil (18,320) in ECD centres hence scrapping all charges,” said Ouko.
