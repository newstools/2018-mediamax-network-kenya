The Anti-Corruption Court yesterday directed the case against Deputy Chief Justice Philomena Mwilu (pictured) to be mentioned on February 18. Milimani Chief Magistrate Lawrence Mugambi fixed the date to allow Mwilu’s lawyers to update the court on the outcome of the case she had filed seeking to stop her prosecution. The move comes after High Court judge Enoch Chacha Mwita, who is hearing her petition directed last week that the file be placed before Chief Justice David Maraga to set up a Bench to hear and determine the case in which she is challenging her prosecution. Mwilu and her co-accused,  lawyer Stanley Muluvi were not in court yesterday during the mention of the case before a lower court but their lawyers, urged the court to give them more time to finalise the High Court matter. Mwita ruled that because it is the first time a senior judge was arrested in the precincts of the court for possible prosecution since the promulgation of the current Constitution, the matters raised in the case need to be determined by a three-judge Bench.
