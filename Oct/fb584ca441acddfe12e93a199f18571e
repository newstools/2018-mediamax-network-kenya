More than 300 families in three villages in Rangwe, Homa Bay, have been rendered homeless after their houses were damaged by a  storm. The families in Lidha, Odel, Komoth and Kabuor villages in Kotieno and Gem East locations spent the night in the cold yesterday after their houses were swept away in a downpour accompanied by strong winds. Crops were also destroyed in the Saturday night storm. Some families, whose house roofs and walls were destroyed, took refuge at a local church. Pamela Auma said she and her children have no choice but camp at the church until her house is repaired. Cristina Akumu, a resident of Odel, said residents are facing starvation unless they receive food aid. “Most of the food in stores was destroyed,” she said. Philip Achieng’ said the roof of his house was blown off. He said it will take time before he can reconstruct his house. Peter Otieno, a fish farmer, said his fish were swept by flood water which filled the ponds. Kotineo chief John Odhiambo and his Gem East counterpart James Amimo appealed to the government to assist affected families. “Some families have children who are going to sit national examinations. I appeal to the government to help such families,” said Odhiambo.
