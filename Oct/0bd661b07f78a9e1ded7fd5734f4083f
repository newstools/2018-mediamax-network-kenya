Kirera Mwiti and Dickens Wasonga @PeopleDailyKe Road accident deaths have risen by seven per cent this year according to the latest statistics from the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA). Pedestrians and motorcycle operators are the most affected while reckless driving has been cited as the main cause for accidents in public service transport. In the figures released early this month, 2,214 people lost their lives from January to September this year, a rise from 2,053 in the same period last year. According to NTSA director for road safety Njeri Waithaka, this represents a  7.4 per cent increase. Waithaka said most road accidents, particularly those involving public service vehicles, took place during the night. She said many pedestrians are also being killed because of crossing roads in undesignated areas. Waithaka said they were carrying out public awareness campaigns as a means of reducing fatalities. She said a majority of accidents happen along the Nairobi-Nakuru highway. “The Northern Corridor remains one of the most dangerous according to our records and we are working with stakeholders in the transport sector to see how best to deal with the situation,” she said. Waithaka, who was speaking during a stakeholders meeting on Nairobi traffic decongestion plan at a Naivasha hotel,  said they had suspended operations of 12 saccos and deregistered five that were found flouting traffic rules.
