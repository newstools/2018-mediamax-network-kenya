Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi Two prime suspects linked to the killing of former Kakamega District Commissioner Paul Yatich’s wife will remain in custody for 13 days, an Eldoret court directed yesterday. Laban Cheruiyot and Simon Lumile are linked to the killing of Loice Yatich, who until her death was curriculum development officer at the Teachers Service Commission in Uasin Gishu county. When they appeared before chief magistrate Charles Obulutsa’s court, the duo was not allowed to take plea after investigating officer Constable Samuel Kimeli requested for 14 days to complete investigations. Obulutsa ordered the suspects locked in police custody until October 30 when they will take plea. “The accused will be detained at Eldoret West Police Station until October 30 when the investigating officer will have completed  investigations into the killing,” ordered Obulutsa. The suspects were arrested by detectives in Kabiyet township in Nandi county after recovery of the deceased’s vehicle believed to have been  stolen by the suspects  at the victim’s Kiplombe estate home, near Eldoret town. The body was discovered in her house on Tuesday. Yatich, who had separated with his wife for 10 years, said they last spoke on Saturday last week, adding that he however, had attempted to reach her on her phone in vain that Tuesday. Speaking to the press in Eldoret town, Yatich said he tried to reach her but calls went unanswered raising suspicion as she rarely failed to pick his calls. He said he reported the matter at Eldoret West Police Station and was given officers who accompanied him to his home where they found the body.
