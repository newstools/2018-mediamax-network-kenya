Murimi Mutiga @murimimutiga One person died on Friday while several others are still trapped in the rubble after an eight-storey building, which was under construction, collapsed on their houses at Barani area in Malindi, Kilifi county. The building fell on three houses and Gapco petrol station damaging property worth millions of shillings. Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) said 14 people had been rescued. Its Coast regional coordinator Hassan Musa said they were still searching for two people, who were heard calling out for help. He said the injured were taken to Malindi Sub-county Hospital. “The building could have collapsed because of the heavy rains that have hit parts of the region since Wednesday,” said Musa. However, it emerged that the National Construction Authority (NCA) and the National Environmental Management Authority (Nema) had stopped construction of the building after it failed to meet structural standards. “Construction of the commercial building was stopped in May 2013 by Nema, two months after it started, because of structural integrity. However, the owners ignored the orders but last year, the work stopped,” said county Nema Director Samuel Lopokoiyit. Governor Amason Kingi, who was among leaders at the scene, said the county government had brought in excavators and bulldozers to help in the rescue efforts. He, however, said the equipment had not yet been used to ensure safety of those still trapped.
