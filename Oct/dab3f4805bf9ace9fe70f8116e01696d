Chinese companies operating in Kenya floated more than 1,000 job opportunities during the inaugural Kenya-China Economic and Trade Association (KCETA) Career Fair in Nairobi yesterday. Prospective job applicants who have experiences in various professional disciplines thronged different stands at the career fair where over 50 Chinese firms showcased their corporate profiles in the battle for local human talent. Ministry of Foreign Affairs director of Asia and Australasia Affairs, Christopher Chika, welcomed the Chinese companies’ commitment to deepen bilateral relations through career development opportunities. He said such career fairs will continue to play a key role in breaking cultural barriers while providing direct linkages between prospective job seekers and the recruiting firms. “Kenya has established strategic relationships with China, testified by the frequency of the interaction of the two country’s top leadership,” he said during the event’s opening ceremony. In the economic space, Chika added that, more than 400 Chinese companies have been creating quality local jobs and establishing crucial skills transfer linkages for Kenya’s development agenda. He said the forthcoming China International Import Exhibition will be held early next month in Shanghai, China and President Kenyatta would be among the delegates expected to attend. Li Xuhang,  charge d’affaires at the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, said Chinese companies are looking to employ Kenyans holding solid professional competencies and with a passion for hard work and diligence. KCETA is a non-profit organisation with 97 Chinese firms members.
