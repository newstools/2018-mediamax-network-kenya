One person was Friday reported injured at the Olaro Conservancy in Narok West as the battle for resources within the conservancy intensified among members of the community. Olaro manager William Justine is nursing an arrow wound on his right cheek after an unknown attacker shot at him Thursday evening, but has since been discharged after the arrow was removed from his cheek at Ngoswani Health Center.
