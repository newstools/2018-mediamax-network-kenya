Taxpayers lost Sh16 billion through the bungled Class One pupil laptops project by the Information Communication Technology ministry, Auditor General Edward Ouko has revealed. The report shows that payment of Sh15.2 billion as at June 30, 2017 and backed by nine letters of credit, did not include payment vouchers. Ouko says in the report tabled by Leader of Majority  Aden Duale yesterday, that he cannot confirm the aptness  of the expenditure since payment vouchers were not availed for audit review The report further reveals that Sh603.1 million was spent for the supply of laptops as proof of concept even after serious defects were identified. “The implementation Committee went round to inspect the laptops after supply and commissioning of the gadgets and realised that all had factory defects and were supposed to be replaced by the supplier,” said Ouko Another Sh1.6 million meant for the presidential digital talent programme cannot be accounted for. There is also the expenditure of Sh28.32 million in county connectivity project expenses whose supporting documents were also not availed to the auditor general for review. The report is expected to be considered by the National Assembly watchdog committee—Public Accounts Committee (PAC)—chaired by Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi.
