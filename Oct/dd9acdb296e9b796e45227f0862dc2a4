Seth Onyango @SethManex Kenyans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for diesel and kerosene after the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) increased retail prices in the latest fuel review. Motorists and households will pay Sh1.60 and Sh0.43 more per litre, for diesel and kerosene respectively, between today and November 14. There is, however, a marginal reprieve to consumers of super petrol after the retail price dropped by Sh1.06 inclusive of the recently passed eight per cent Value Added Tax (VAT). ERC director general Pavel Oimeke in a statement yesterday attributed new price movements to the average landed cost of imported super petrol which ebbed 1.99 per cent from Sh74,940 per tonne in August to Sh73,450 last month. Conversely, cost of diesel swelled 2.11 per cent from Sh69, 108 per tonne to Sh70,565 and kerosene jumping 0.60 per cent from Sh72, 269 per tonne to Sh72,704 over the same period. Following the latest review, a litre of super petrol will retail at Sh115.73 in Nairobi, while diesel and kerosene will retail at Sh109.72 and Sh108.84. The Free On board (FOB) price of murban crude oil lifted in September was posted at $80.35 (Sh8,035) per barrel, an increase of 7.06 per cent from $75.05 (Sh7,505) per barrel in August. “Over the same period, the mean monthly US Dollar to Kenya shilling exchange rate depredated by 0.17 per cent from Sh100.71 per dollar in August to Sh100.88 per dollar in September,” Oimeke explained. In Mombasa, the super petrol will retail at Sh113.10 with diesel and kerosene retailing at Sh107.10 and Sh106.21 respectively. In Kisumu and Nakuru, super petrol will retail at Sh117.09 and 116.20 respectively while diesel and kerosene will trade at Sh111.40 and 110.41  and Sh110.51 and 109.52 correspondingly. Consumers in far-fetched areas will pay more for the commodities due to transportation cost and other logistics. Prices of kerosene have been a constant causality of the government’s bid to discourage use of paraffin in favour of clean fuels, solar and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (cooking gas). New fuel prices come barely a month after President Uhuru Kenyatta signed into law the Finance Bill 2018, which reversed the initial VAT on petroleum products from 16 to eight per cent. Uhuru’s new fuel tax is to help the National Treasury raise up to Sh30 billion and plug revenue shortfall. More money will be raised from money transfer charges, sugar confectioneries, betting companies and winnings, VAT on kerosene and the newly introduced housing fund. The memorandum proposed a deletion of 0.05 per cent “Robin Hood” tax regime, which had been proposed on the money transfers of at least Sh500,000. Betting companies will be charged 15 per cent on top of the 30 per cent they pay on corporate income, while the winners will have to part with 20 per cent of their winnings to the National Treasury.
