A conflict is brewing in Olarro conservancy  in Narok South, with local residents accusing the conservancy security of opening fire at their animals, which were grazing in the conservancy. The community says it  leased out the 12,000 acres of land to the conservancy and therefore have a right to benefit from the said land.
