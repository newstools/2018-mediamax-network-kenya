Self-confessed serial killer Philip Onyancha wants the High Court to grant him bail pending hearing and determination of a fresh murder trial over the killing of a nine-year-old in 2014 at Dagoretti, Nairobi county. During his bail application hearing yesterday, Onyancha told Justice Jessie Lesiit that he is not insane as alleged by the prosecution, who strongly objected his release on bail. While applying for bail, Onyancha  maintained that he is a family man with two children who depend on him. Onyancha, who has been on trial for eight years, said if granted bail, he would abide by conditions set by the court. He lodged the bail application after pleading afresh to the murder charges after former trial judge James Wakiaga ordered for his re-trial on April 5, 2018. In his judgement, Wakiaga declared a mistrial in the case against Onyancha. The court will rule on his bail application on November 1.
