Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Retired President Moi yesterday marked Moi Day quietly at his Kabarak home with family and friends.  He described as overwhelming the goodwill messages sent to him by Kenyans of all walks of life and thanked them for their expression of love for him and the many fond memories. Moi’s press team said he called for peace and unity in the country and prayed for God’s blessings for the country and its people. Moi Day was last observed before the promulgation of the new Constitution which delisted it from national holidays. But a court ruling last year reinstated it. Most Kenyans marked the day yesterday either at home or with loved ones at recreational centres. After the day was abolished in 2002, in 2003 and for the next few years that followed, Moi marked the holiday by visiting Arap Moi Children’s home where he donated food and non-foodstuff. He also visited St Nicholas Ngala Special School and Street Children Association Network in Nakuru town. Popularly known for his generosity, the former president marked the day after retiring by donating bread, rice, sugar, cooking oil and biscuits among others. On Monday, Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i gazetted Wednesday as a public holiday to celebrate Moi Day. This followed last year’s court ruling by Justice George Odunga, which reinstated the day as a public holiday on grounds that its removal was in contravention of the Public Holidays Act. “Going by this decision, therefore, October 10 shall be a public holiday,” said Matiang’i. “Owing to the elaborate celebrations lined up for all our heroes on Mashujaa Day (October 20), I make no pronouncement on the manner in which October 10 shall be celebrated,” he added. Odunga had said unless Parliament changes the law to scrap it or the Interior CS substitutes it with another fete, Kenyans would continue observing the day.
