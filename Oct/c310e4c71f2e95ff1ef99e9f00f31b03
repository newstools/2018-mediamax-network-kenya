Winstone Chiseremi @Wchiseremi President Uhuru Kenyatta has said he will not be distracted by critics of his administration in his quest to implement the Big 4 agenda. He vowed to ensure success of the development programme despite  what he said are attempts to divert his focus from the promise he made to the people. He was speaking yesterday in Nandi County during a funds drive towards construction of the Anglican Church of Kenya, Kapsabet Diocese plaza. “My concentration is the unity of Kenyans and fulfilling the Big 4 agenda for their benefit. I will not listen to empty rhetoric that will only distract my attention,” he said. He said the government will continue to roll out development projects in all parts of country regardless of political and religious affiliations. “Let us pay tax so that we can finance our mega projects for the benefit of our country and its citizens. We should learn to be independent and self-reliant instead of relying on foreign donors to finance our development programmes,” he said. He was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto, Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Senate Leader of Majority Kipchumba Murkomen, Governor Stephen Sang and his Uasin Gishu counterpart Jackson Mandago.
