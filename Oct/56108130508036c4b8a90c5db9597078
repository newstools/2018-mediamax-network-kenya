Harambee Stars will have to wait a little bit longer to know if they will be participating in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) after Sierra Leone who have been banned by Fifa failed to reach to a consensus with the world governing body. Kenya beat Ethiopia 3-0 in an AFCON Group F qualifier in Nairobi last week to put themselves on the threshold of qualification to the 2019 finals earmarked for Cameroon. Fifa met Sierra Leone authorities this week to discuss certain conditions for Leone Stars, which has been banned following government’s interference in football matters. Sierra Leone is seeking to be readmitted to the qualifiers but nothing concrete was reached in the meeting, hence the retention of the status quo by Fifa. The banishment of Sierra Leone in all football activities held under aegis of Fifa and CAF remains as efforts to have the ban lifted was rejected last Tuesday due to failure to comply with demands. Fifa had stressed that without Sierra Leone Football Association (SLFA) President Isha Johansen and secretary general Chris Camara regaining full leadership of the FA, the ban on Sierra Leone stands. The duo were prevailed upon to step down by the country’s anti-corruption body after graft charges were brought against them even as the government raided the Sierra Leone Football Association (SFA) premises in Freetown which prompted Fifa to impose the ban following several warnings against the perceived third party interference.
