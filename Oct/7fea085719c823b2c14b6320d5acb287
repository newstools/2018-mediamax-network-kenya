Kitui Governor Charity Ngilu has urged expectant women to deliver in hospitals to avoid fistula complications. Ngilu decried the rising number of fistula cases in the county caused by prolonged and obstructed labour, which could be prevented with emergency Caesarean section (CS) if women deliver in health facilities. Speaking at the county referral hospital in Kitui town yesterday, she said basic fistula screening was available at the facility and urged those with complicated cases to visit nearby hospitals for confirmation tests and subsequent treatment. “We urge all women of reproductive age to make use of our trained health workers and equipped facilities to reduce the risk of complications that result to fistula,” she said. The county is holding its first free fistula medical camp, targeting at least 30 women for corrective surgery.
