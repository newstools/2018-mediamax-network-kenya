Shabana will need Sh20 million to achieve their ambitions of returning to the top-flight SportPesa Premier League. Tore Bore regained promotion to the second tier National Super League (NSL) following a 7-6 post-match penalties victory over Taita Taveta’s Mwatate United and head coach Rix Kanuli has warned the club’s faithful not to expect an easy passage to the top flight without investment. “A realistic figure for the forthcoming campaign would be in the region of Sh20 million. We have to put good structures in place, source for quality players while churning out new talent as well. This is a huge investment but with goodwill, it is the only way to see this club gain back its lost glory. We want to compete with the big boys again but only if we are prepared adequately,” said Kanuli who has been in charge for four seasons. He added: “This is something the management has to look into urgently. No sporting organisation can blossom without a development plan. I hope in the coming days, we can sit together and plot the future of Shabana. Now that we have what has been a challenging season behind us, it is important to think long term.” The former Kenyan Premier League heavyweights finished runners up in the FKF Division One Zone B League to book a playoff slot with Mwatate, having endured financial woes all season.
