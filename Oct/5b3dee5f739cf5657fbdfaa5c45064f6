National women football team Harambee Starlets head coach David Ouma says the team has to work on their finishing ahead of next month’s African Women’s Cup of Nations (AWCON) in Ghana. While admitting that the team struggled to convert the chances they created in the AWCON qualifier matches as well as during CECAFA matches, Ouma says he is working on changing the approach of his players towards goal. “Our finishing is a good concern because goals form a larger part of the principal and success of football. We have had a problem with scoring therefore something has to change. During the qualifiers and CECAFA, our strikers were playing wide and that might have cost us,” said Ouma. During CECAFA, Ouma charges won just one match, 2-0 against hosts Rwanda. They lost 1-0 to Uganda and Ethiopia and drew 1-1with holders Tanzania. The side had a chance to win their second round AWCON qualifier home match against Equatorial Guinea by a higher margin but wasted most of their chances winning 2-1. “We have to work on the tactical behaviour and formation of our strikers in front of goal as well as their combination for different matches. Each match will require a different approach but I am doing my best to instil a contact-football mentality in my strikers. The players have to accept to be tackled as through such contact, goals are won,” said Ouma further explaining that the kind of balls the strikers are fed from the midfield largely determine their output. He has called on all departments to give their all. Starlets hit camp on Monday with a bulk of the Western Kenya based players arriving in camp on Tuesday morning owing to weekend’s Women Premier League (WPL) matches.
