Simon Nthusi @PeopleDailyKe Parents and teachers of Mawani Primary School in Kilome sub-county, Makueni county have appealed to the government, donors and well- wishers for aid to build classrooms. Pupils at the school are forced to study in dilapidated structures. Started five years ago with nine pupils, the school has 46 learners. Head teacher Lucy Galari said teaching at the school is a challenge because of harsh weather conditions. “Sometimes especially during the rainy season we are forced to cut the lessons short,” she said. A parent, Teresia Nyamai, said pupils suffer from complicated eye problems, and persistent coughs because of exposure to strong winds and dust. Her sentiments were shared by another parent Caroline  Makau who said teachers are forced to sprinkle water in the classrooms everyday. Galari said efforts to mobilise parents to conduct a fund raiser for the cause have failed.
