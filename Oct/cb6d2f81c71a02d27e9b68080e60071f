Cheranganyi MP Joshua Kuttuny has castigated the government for putting a ceiling of 75 shillings on the price of a 2kg packet of Unga, saying that the government intends to buy maize from farmers at a  throw away price. Kuttuny says that the government plans to buy maize from farmers at 1600 shillings per bag, which will turn  maize farming a loss making venture. He now wants the Agriculture Cabinet Secretary to offer a good price to maize farmers for their produce.
