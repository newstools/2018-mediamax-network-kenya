Torome Tirike in Germany  @tiriks Germany and Bundesliga legend Lothar Matthaus has called on African clubs to invest in youth academies for talent sustainability. Matthaus, who won lifted the 1990 World Cup trophy as Germany captain, says this is the only way for these clubs to compete favourably and also churn out talent that can go on to play for some of the world’s best teams. “Africa should embrace forming youth leagues to develop football in the continent. Africa can learn a lot from Bundesliga’s Kick and Read philosophy where we are encouraging players to pursue education on and off the pitch,” said the seven-time Bundesliga winner. Matthaus, who was also crowned the 1991 World Player of the Year, was addressing a group of African journalists currently attending a Bundesliga workshop in Germamy. The journalists, who include K24 sports editor Torome Tirike are in Germany courtesy of pay TV firm StarTimes who are the sole Bundesliga rights holders for Sub-Saharan Africa. Lessons on league marketing, crowd control, youth development and women’s football were part of the agenda for the African scribes who also got the rare opportunity to watch a live Bundesliga match between hosts Hoffeinheim and second from bottom Stuttgart which the later won 4-0 on Saturday. Hoffenheim romped to the huge win against 10-man Stuttgart, who had defender Emiliano Insua sent off after just eight minutes for a dangerous foul on Pavel Kaderabek. Stuttgart held their shape in Sinsheim until their defence disintegrated with four goals in 12 second-half minutes. The journalists were also in attendance at the Red Bull Arena yesterday when home team RB Leipzig took on struggling Schalke 04. K2 TV is now StarTimes’ free-to-air Bundesliga partner in Kenya and are screening a live match from the German top flight every Saturday.
