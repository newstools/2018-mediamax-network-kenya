Seth Onyango @SethManex The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) has urged the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to expedite investigations into the alleged of fraud at the Milimani Law Courts in Nairobi. In a statement to newsrooms, society President Allen Gichuhi expressed concern over claims that law firms have not been remitting monies for the filing of plaints. “LSK is alarmed by these allegations and on behalf of its members, urges the authorities to investigate fully and get to the bottom of this matter which clearly points to actions of staff members working in the Judiciary’s Registry possibly working in collision with others including clerks serving in several law firms,” he said. He, however, told detectives not to victimise members of the society, many of who have been implicated in the fraud. Detectives have since roped in about 500 law firms in the alleged loss of Sh36 million at the Milimani courts.
