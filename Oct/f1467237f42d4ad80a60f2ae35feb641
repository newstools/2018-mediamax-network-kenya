Sofapaka president Elly Kalekwa insists Mathias Kigonya is still their player despite the Ugandan import having expressed his desire to leave the club. Kalekwa’s sentiments comes barely a week after Kigonya accused the team’s executive of denying him a release letter to part ways with the 2009 Kenyan Premier League champions. Kiogonya, who scored four goals for Batoto Ba Mungu in the just concluded season, all from the penalty spot despite being a shot-stopper, stunned the Sofapaka faithful a fortnight ago when he authored a letter requesting to leave. The Ugandan has since been linked with moves to league rivals AFC Leopards and Tusker. Tusker, however, look like the more serious contender for Kigonya’s signature after they lost the services of first choice Harambee Stars custodian Patrick Matasi to Ethiopian champion St George’s. Kalekwa says Kigonya wants to leave the club without following the laid down procedures. “Kigonya is not a free agent. We cannot give him a release letter just because he wants to leave. Remember, he has nine more months on his contract with Sofapaka and his impending move to another club is illegal,” said Kalekwa. He added: “Football is business and since Kigonya’s contract runs up to June 2019, he is still our player. We are ready to release him but any team that is looking for his signature should talk to us first if we are to strike a deal.” Kigonya, who had earlier been linked with a move to Al Hilal of Sudan, now says that he will consider available offers on the table before he makes a final decision.
