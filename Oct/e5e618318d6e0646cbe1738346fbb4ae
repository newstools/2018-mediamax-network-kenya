Dinah Ondari @dinahondari Senators now want the government to scrap clearance certificates as a requirement for those seeking employment at public institutions. The legislators unanimously supported a petition by Nominated senator Isaac Mwaura which calls for scrapping of the documents, whose issuance attract a fee of not less that Sh1,000 each. They are the certificates of good conduct, clearances from the Credit Reference Bureau, Ethics and Anti-corruption Commissions, Kenya Revenue Authority and the Higher Education Loans Board. Mwaura argues that the retirement age should be lowered from 60 to 55 years to create more employment opportunities for the youth. Cumulatively, one is required to pay a minimum of Sh6,000 to get the documents. Nairobi Senator Johnson Sakaja said the levies is evidence of the government’s apathetic approach to issues affecting the youth.
