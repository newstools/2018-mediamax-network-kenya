George Kebaso @Morarak Members of the National Assembly Health Committee want the government to tame corruption and mismanagement of resources in the health sector to effectively roll out and sustain Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Speaking during a national health financing dialogue in Nairobi yesterday, the members stressed the need to curb pilferage if the programme, which is one of the pillars in President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda, is to attain intended goals. “Tackle rampant corruption in the health sector, end pilferage and raise numbers of personnel to strengthen primary healthcare delivery,” said the MPs led by committee chair Sabina Chege (pictured), who is also Murang’a Woman Representative. Members James Nyikal (Seme), Swarup Mishra (Kesses), Martin Owino (Ndhiwa) and Mohamud Sheikh (Wajir South) also attended the event. They called for the overhaul of the health sector to improve service delivery. Sabina said while the National Assembly is pushing the government to increase health budgetary allocation from the current 13 per cent to 15 per cent, it wants to be actively involved  in the rollout of UHC. “For us to deal with the disease burden in this country, we have to embrace community health workers and start paying them,” said Sabina.
