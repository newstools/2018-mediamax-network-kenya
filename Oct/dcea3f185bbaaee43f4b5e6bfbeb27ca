Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission Chairman Wafula Chebukati has cleared the air on the sacking of the commission’s Chief Executive Officer, Ezra Chiloba. Chubukati defended the commission’s move, saying they terminated the services of Chiloba after finding him culpable of gross misconduct, and breach of procurement and administration rules in relation to the 2017 general elections and the fresh presidential polls, maintaining he had been granted a fair hearing. This even as calls to reconstitute the commission intensifies.
