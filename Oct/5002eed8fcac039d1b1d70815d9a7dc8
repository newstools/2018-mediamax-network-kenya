Seven National Land Commissioners (NLC) employees are expected to testify against their former boss, Muhammed Swazuri and 16 others, the Anti-Corruption Court heard yesterday. The revelations were made during a mention of an application by Swazuri who accused the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) and NLC of disobeying court orders. Appearing before chief magistrate Lawrence Mugambi, he said the court cannot hear any application since the  file is before the High Court. “The High Court has asked for the file. We have to wait until it returns it,” he said. Through his lawyers, the embattled Swazuri wants to be allowed to get back to office.“EACC have imprisoned my client. He cannot go to his office and serve Kenyans,” court was told. Last week, Swazuri filed an application seeking review of bail. The matter is yet to be heard.
