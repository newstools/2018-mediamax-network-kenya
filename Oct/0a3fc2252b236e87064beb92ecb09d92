A group of legislators yesterday walked out of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s function in Bomet to protest being left out of the speakers’ list. The legislators who had turned up for the launch of the new Bomet University College tuition block by the President accused Governor Joyce Laboso of denying them the chance to speak at the ceremony. Among the leaders who walked  out in a huff were Senator Christopher Lang’at, Woman Rep Joyce Korir and Ronald Tonui (Bomet Central). Others were Brighton Yegon (Konoin), Beatrice Kones (Bomet East), Gideon Koskei (Chepalungu) and Nominated Senator Alice Milgo. The leaders, who addressed residents at the Bomet Stadium before leading a procession in the streets of the town, expressed disappointment about what they claimed was Governor Laboso’s scheme to undermine them. They said they had “pressing” issues which they wanted to raise with the President and his Deputy President William Ruto. “There are many problems bedevilling our people which we hoped our leaders would help us speak about but sadly we were not given a chance,” said Tonui.
