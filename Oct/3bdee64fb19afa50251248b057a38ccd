 President Uhuru Kenyatta has issued a one month ultimatum to the ministry of agriculture  to  provide a report explaining how 20 Billion shillings allocated for the revival of the sugar sector was used. Kenyatta said the money was swindled by cartels at the expense of farmers and demanded  a clear frame work from the ministry on how the industry will be revived. Kenyatta spoke when he met leaders from Western Kenya before engaging another delegation led by Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka.
