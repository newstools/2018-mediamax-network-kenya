Bernard Gitau @benagitau The controversy surrounding ownership of the land on which Weston Hotel,  associated with  Deputy President William Ruto, sits  is expected to be resolved this morning as the National Land Commission (NLC) meets to review title deeds. NLC says it will be sitting to review various title deeds and grants to ascertain ownership and propriety as mandated by the Constitution. Among the titles to be reviewed is LR 209/14372 where Weston Hotel, Nairobi sits, claimed by Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA). Ruto is battling to save the hotel from imminent demolition after KCAA wrote to the NLC alleging its land was irregularly acquired. “The reviews will be held on  October 31 at ACK Bishop Annex 7th floor boardroom from 10am,” said NLC in a statement. Ruto’s lawyer, Ahmednasir Abdullahi, recently appeared before the NLC at a sitting presided over by vice chairperson Abigael Mbagaya to defend the Deputy President’s acquisition of the plot on Lang’ata road. During today’s sitting, Ruto and KCCA will be making their submissions in order for the commission to make a ruling.
