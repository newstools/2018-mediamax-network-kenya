Evans Nyakundi @PeopleDailyKe Auditor-General Edward Ouko has dispatched accountants to Nyamira county following reported corruption cases for the last four months. The auditors are expected to look into the account books of all the departments and those of the County Assembly, following complaints from area leaders and members of the public that the tendering and procurement of the Sh379 million Assembly administration block was riddled with corruption. The more than six officers, who sought anonymity, said  they have already detected a lot of anomalies in some departments. “Ours is to expose how the public funds sent to and collected from the county are being utilised,” said an officer. The auditors dismissed claims that they had been compromised by the county government to cover up any financial irregularities encountered. Some leaders and county workers had claimed the Treasury department was collecting funds from various departments to compromise the auditors. However, county Treasury head Lawrence Nyangena refuted the claims. Audit queries have been raised in the Roads department, doctors plaza,Manga stadium, Water department and the Assembly administration block, among other areas. An internal auditor, who did not want to be quoted, said no action had been taken for those implicated in misuse of funds in their earlier reports. Meanwhile, interviews for chief officer positions in  the countyhave been suspended until further notice, the County Service Board chairman Peter Nyakundi said yesterday. This comes after members of the public and some applicants protested after realising some shortlisted candidates were part of the interviewing board. Nyakundi said the board vice chair Beatrice Siriba was one of the shortlisted candidates. Two other board officials had applied for the posts but  withdrew their applications before the shortlisting exercise.
