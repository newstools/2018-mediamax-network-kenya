The ministry of education earlier this year rolled out the new 2-6-6-3, competency based curriculum for pre-primary as well as grade 1,2 and 3  amid protests from various stakeholders that the country was not ready to phase out the 32 year old, 8-4-4 education system. And nearly a year on,teachers and learners alike seem to be reaping the rewards of the learner based teaching methodology and the introduction of new learning areas to instil the values of love, leadership and  patriotism. Shukri Wachu spend time at Nairobi Primary school and  tells us how learning has changed under the new competency based curriculum.
