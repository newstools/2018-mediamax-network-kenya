The Nyamira High Court yesterday was moved to  tears when an  eight-year-old boy narrated how his father beheaded his mother. Samuel Otieno is accused of killing his wife Beatrice Masuka on October 10, 2015  at Bonyaiguba in Nyamira South sub-county. He has, however, denied the charges. The boy told the court  his father found the mother cooking before he took a machete and slashed her. “My father ordered me to go and sleep, but I pretended that I was asleep and watched everything as it happened,”  he  said. His elder sister also testified in the case. Hearing continues.
