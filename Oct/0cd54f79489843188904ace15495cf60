Four people have been confirmed dead in fresh attacks in the hostile Kapedo area along the Baringo – Turkana border after suspected bandits from a neighbouring community ambushed a group of livestock traders  while on their way  from Kapao to Ameyan market. Another  trader who sustained gun shot wounds is currently recuperating at the Baringo referral hospital even as residents called on the government to deploy additional security personnel to the area order to restore sanity.
