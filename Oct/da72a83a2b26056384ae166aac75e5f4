Barry Silah @obel_barry Newly-promoted KCB Football Club has waded into the SportPesa Premier League 2018/19 season albeit with renewed vigour and ambitions. Having picked 78 points off 36 matches in arguably the most challenging season in the National Super League (NSL), the bankers are keen to make an immediate mark. Already there has been a shake-up at the top for the forthcoming campaign. Immediate former Wazito tactician Frank Ouna comes in on a two-year contract as the coach to replace Elvis Ayany who heralded the moneyed team back to the Premiership. KCB chairman Azu Ogola opined that Ouna came through a competitive process to get the job. “People can argue non-objectively about what transpired at Wazito and then question Ouna’s credentials. We have to recall he operated under extremely difficult conditions and somewhere in between lost key personnel. He passed our needs test and besides he has the requisite qualifications to coach a premiership side. So it might seem a gamble but the new coach has our full backing,” he said adding that Ouna would be assisted by Ezekiel Akwana formerly of relegated NSL side Nakuru All-Stars. Young upcoming coach Ayany and trainer Michael Oyando; both former players of the club will also be retained at the technical bench. According to Ogola, the duo has gone through the ranks and the club will continue helping in ensuring that they excel. “We know their value and passion for the club and football. It will be a mistake to discard them, they will need support, especially from the new coaches at the helm,” added Ogola who is convinced KCB can challenge for a top eight slot in the new campaign. He said soon there will be a sustainable recruitment exercise driven by the coaches to spruce the team. Ayany also welcomed the new coaches at the helm and believed that they would add value to the club’s ambitions.
