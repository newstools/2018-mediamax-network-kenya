The prosecution in the corruption case against Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong yesterday suffered a setback after a witness was stood down following denial that he recorded a statement to indict the governor. Nicodemus Mulako, who is Busia County Secretary, told trial magistrate Douglas Ogoti that the statement presented by the prosecution was not authored by him. The statement dated May 7, 2014 was not recorded by the  witness, who said that by then he had not joined the county government. Ojaamong lawyers led by James Orengo and Danstan Omari, told the court that the  witness cannot by law be allowed to testify using an  unsigned statement that was not recorded by him. They argued that the prosecution has not availed the original statement to prove the  author. Ojaamong and five others  county executives have been charged  with conspiracy to defraud the county Sh8 million by starting projects without following proper procurement process.
