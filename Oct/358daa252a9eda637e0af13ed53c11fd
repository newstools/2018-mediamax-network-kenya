National Olympic Committee of Kenya (NOCK) boss Paul Tergat has underscored the need for Kenyans not to overly depend on athletics to win medals for the country in Olympic Games. Tergat says Kenya, which is an athletics powerhouse, should diversify in several sports disciplines like other nations and gave an example of China and Russia who have a wide scope of events they take part in during Olympics. “The Olympic Games is about winning medals. A nation cannot emerge tops if it competes in only one or two disciplines,” Tergat said. The athletics legend made the remarks during a breakfast meeting hosted to the team which represented the country during this year’s Youth Olympic Games held in Buenos Aires, Argentina. “As we look forward to the next edition of the competition (Youth Olympics) that will be held in Dakar, Senegal in 2022, let us try and put together as many teams as possible for the games so that we can broaden our medal scope,” he added. During the just-concluded event, Russia emerged overall champions after scooping 59 medals, 29 gold, 13 silver and 12 bronze while Kenya finished 26th with three gold medals and a bronze. The Kenyan squad consisted of 20 players who took part in athletics, hockey, swimming and javelin and Tergat has called on the country to invest in technical expertise for training athletes, adding that the era of sportspeople training through you tube is long gone. Anthony Kariuki, Chef de Mission to the games, said the lone Kenyan swimmer did not compete because she fell sick before the aquatic event commenced. A total of 206 nations, 6,000 athletes and 3,000 officials graced the games.
