Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe Siaya County government plans to rehabilitate dams in the county to boost food security. Speaking at Ajigo in Bondo constituency during World Food Day, Governor Cornel Rasanga said his administration will also roll out mega irrigation programmes targeting youth in small-scale farming. He said dams dug by colonial administration in 1950s will be rehabilitated and their water harnessed to support irrigation. He directed the department of Agriculture to plan to rehabilitate dams and put aside a kitty that will benefit small-scale farmers to put idle land into agricultural production to stabilising the region’s food security. He said the county government will ensure all the water reservoirs are rehabilitated and redesigned to provide drinking and irrigation water to the farmers who are keen on investing in food production for local consumption and export. “The community has a duty to protect the environment as the government is committed to diverting from rain-fed agriculture to irrigation farming to meet the needs of the increased population,” Rasanga said. The governor, who visited several agricultural stands and witnessed various products that have undergone value addition, appealed to residents to practise modern farming technologies. He said his government was committed to alleviating hunger and poverty through food production. The governor said to boost agriculture in the county, his government has bought and supplied 185.6 metric tonnes of certified seeds, 385.5 metric tonnes planting fertiliser and 277 metric tonnes of top dressing fertiliser.
