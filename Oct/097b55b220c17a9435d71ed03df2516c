Cristiano Ronaldo is the footballer with the midas touch and his sporting prowess, star appeal and model looks have already netted him a Sh4.6 billion (£350m) fortune. Now one of the star’s biggest backers says it is “closely monitoring” claims he raped a former model in a Las Vegas hotel in 2009. They are unproven claims the star vehemently denies but they have cast a huge shadow over the on and off-pitch career of the world’s most marketable footballer. EA Sports use Ronaldo as the face of their huge Fifa gaming franchise – with this year’s latest edition featuring the Juve ace on the cover. But with police in America launching a criminal investigation into the former Real Madrid striker, the gaming giant says it is keeping close tabs on the claims. An EA spokesperson told The Sun Online: “We have seen the concerning report that details allegations against Cristiano Ronaldo. “We are closely monitoring the situation, as we expect cover athletes and ambassadors to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with EA’s values.” His other current mega endorsement deals include long-term multimillion pound contracts with Nike, nutrition giant Herbalife, Tag Heuer and luggage firm American Tourister. The 33-year-old was the highest-paid athlete in the world for the second straight year in 2017 pocketing £70m – including £25m in mega licensing deals. Big name sponsors clearly recognise the value Ronaldo brings to the table which is why Nike signed him up for a lifetime deal at the end of 2016 reportedly worth $1billion (£760m).
