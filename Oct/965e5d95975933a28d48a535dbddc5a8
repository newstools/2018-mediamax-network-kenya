Jackline Nzisa @jackie_nzisa Tourism stakeholders yesterday termed the death of Sarova hotels chairman Mohinder Singh Vohra, who perished together with his family members in a road accident on Sunday on Mombasa- Nairobi highway, a big loss to the hotel industry. Mohinder, his wife, daughter and daughter-in law died while on their way from Makindu Sikh Temple where they had attended a memorial service for JS  Vohra their son who died in a road accident near Emali. Mohinder’s son, Saveer Vohra, who was driving the car at the time of the accident, was taken to Sultan Hamud hospital before being airlifted to Nairobi where he is admitted in hospital. Former Diani Reef Hotel chief executive Titus Kangangi termed the death a big blow to the hotel industry saying the Vohras were the pioneers of hotel tourism in Kenya. He, however added that the mantle is now in the hands of Jimmy Kariuki who took over last year as the managing director of the Sarova hotel business after the demise of JS Vohra. The Kariuki and Vohra are founders of Sarova Hotels whose journey began in 1974. Kenya Tourism Federation chairperson Mohammed Hersi also sent his condolences to the family and industry players saying he had known the Vohra for long. Hersi raised concerns over Mombasa-Nairobi highway being narrow which he said could be the cause of many accidents. “I was made to understand that Vohra was avoiding a lorry which had overtaken another vehicle while he was at a high speed. While moving away from the road, the car veered into to a ditch,” he said.
