Mercy Mwai @wangumarci National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi yesterday led MPs on an inspection tour of the ladies washroom as part of the ongoing investigations into the bribery claims over the sugar report that was rejected by the House in August. He led the members of the Powers and Privileges committee for the inspection to familiarise themselves with the toilets after Kiambu Women’s Rep Gathoni Wamuchomba claimed this is where she learned that her Wajir counterpart Fatuma Gedi was dishing out money to members to reject the report. Following the tour, the committee is expected to once again invite Wamuchomba to get clarifications on some of the issues they will have gathered. Wamuchomba who had appeared before the committee two weeks ago, claimed that she knew it was Gedi who was dishing out the money after two female MPs  who were in the ladies cubicles engaged in a conversation saying how much each was given. The move by the committee comes after Muturi requested members to avail themselves for the inspection as part of the investigations.
