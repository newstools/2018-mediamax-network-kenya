Barcelona, Sunday Barcelona and Luis Suarez humilated Real Madrid in El Clasico on Sunday to leave coach Julen Lopetegui close to being sacked. The Catalan club put five goals past their rivals, three from the boot of Suarez, to move back to the top of LaLiga. Ernesto Valverde’s men were dominant in all areas of the pitch for the majority of the game, although there was a brief period in the second half where Madrid could have levelled the scores. Goals in the first half from Philippe Coutinho and Suarez had put Barca into a 2-0 lead at the break, but Marcelo’s strike brought the visitors back into the contest. Karim Benzema then had a free header that would have levelled the scores, but he guided his attempt over the bar. Suarez punished the Frenchman by notching a second and then completed his hat-trick to put the game beyond doubt. Arturo Vidal poured on the agony late on, scoring a fifth goal with a close-range header. Lopetegui was under huge pressure before the match, it’s difficult to see a long-future for him at the Bernabeu after this hammering.                         -GOAL
