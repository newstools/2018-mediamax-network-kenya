Hunt for points continued at the weekend as Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) league organisers race against time to clear the bulk of fixtures before the rainy season hits them. National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) men’s team extended their lead to 23 points after a commanding 66-16 win over struggling Dedan Kimathi University. The 2014 title-holders scored at will against the seemingly inept students with Timothy Kirimi and William Marui leading the score count with 13 and 10 goals respectively. At the half-time, the millers were leading 31-7 with Dedan Kimathi managing nine more points in the second half. The win inches NCPB closer to a first title in four years. Meanwhile, title-holders Black Mamba are breathing down the NCPB’s neck as they hold second position with 22 points with an unbeaten 11 match run. Mamba added insult to injury to the Nyeri-based students, subjecting them to a 48-12 loss. “The league is very competitive and more matches demand for better concentration and even better match preparation. That is what we are working at every day. Luckily, I have enjoyed an injury-free season so far and I hope the good form extends to the end of the season and on to the playoffs,” said Mamba head coach Martin Abunde. The long-serving tactician singled out Rangers from Kakamega as a real threat to their title campaign apart from the usual competition in Ulinzi, Strathmore and NCPB. “We can handle these other teams but Rangers have proved to be good and can pose a real threat. They finished 11th last season and are yet to lose any match so far,” he added. It was a tough weekend for Dedan Kimathi as they also lost to Ulinzi 56-17 and 43-13 against Strathmore. The league is played outdoors hence the rush to clear the backlog of matches before the heavens open up.
