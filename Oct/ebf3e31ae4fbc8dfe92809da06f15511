Former Ruaraka OCS Nahashon Mutua, who was charged with the murder of an inmate five years ago, will know his fate on November 29. High Court trial judge Stella Mutua set the verdict date after parties in the case made their final submissions. Mutua has since denied torturing Martin Koome to death on December 19, 2013 at Ruaraka Police Station. He allegedly attacked the deceased using a metal bar, inflicting fatal head injuries, and immersed his head in a drum of water. He also hatched a scheme to cover up the murder by implicating Koome’s cellmate, Kelvin Odhiambo, who has since be acquitted of murder. Senior State Counsel Alloys Kemo yesterday urged the court to convict him saying the prosecution had proven the case beyond  reasonable doubt.
