Bernard Gitau @benagitau Two young innovators sponsored by the government for the historic Kenya Airways inaugural direct flight from Nairobi to New York on October 28 have been revealed. Shirlene Nafula and Evans Wadongo, both 26 years, will be among 234 passengers in the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. State House Spokesperson Kanze Dena and Kenya Airways Head of Corporate Social Responsibility and Corporate Events Jacquie Muhati handed them their return tickets at State House Nairobi yesterday. Dena said the two entrepreneurs were picked on the basis of their creativity and innovation in the areas of biotechnology and solar energy. “They will be in US for three days as way of bench marking on how to expand their ventures,” said Dena. Nafula, a University of Nairobi Bachelor of Science in Microbiology and Biotechnology graduate, is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Crystal River Products which manufactures bio-based beauty and hygiene products. Wadongo designed a solar-powered LED lantern called Mwanga Bora, an invention which is fast replacing smoky kerosene lamps and firelight in rural areas.
