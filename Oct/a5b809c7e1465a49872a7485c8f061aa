Fred Aminga @faminga Kenya Power (KP) has disclosed a 25 per cent drop in net earnings for the year ended June 2018, compared to the previous year. The move by the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE)-listed company means the firm is set to post a net profit in the region of Sh5.45 billion, compared to Sh7.27 billion posted June last year. In a profit warning yesterday, KP acting chief executive Jared Othieno announced the dip in net earnings citing a depressed economy, poor rainfalls and politics. “Revenue growth in the year was constrained by the depressed economic environment, poor hydrological conditions in 2017 and protracted electioneering. This slow business environment led to a significant decline in the company’s financial performance,” said Othieno in a statement. In addition, increasing financing costs and delayed review of retail electricity tariffs were also fingered as reasons for the reduced earnings. KP has in the last two years been running an aggressive consumer connection initiative to connect 70 per cent of the population to the national grid through the Last Mile Connectivity initiative. The firm went on to record a less than one per cent rise in profit after tax in June 2017, posting Sh7.27 billion net earnings, after transmission and distribution costs increased by 16.6 per cent from Sh28.7 billion to Sh33.4 billion over that period. Higher operational and maintenance costs on expanded electricity network, depreciation on increased capital investment and the rising cost of doing business were cited as part of the slow growth. However, the utility firm announced it is in the process of making strategic changes to arrest declining performance by diversification of revenue streams and focusing on improving its customers’ experience. It also intends to come up with initiatives that will spur demand for electricity. Tariff change Unfortunately, this comes even as the government moves to change tariffs a second time following President Uhuru Kenyatta’s directive to the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to favour small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Initially, KP had banked on increased power consumption from industrial customers under the discounted night-time tariff plan to spur growth in revenue. But the President’s order to reduce the cost of electricity for SMEs within one month means while this could be a major reprieve to the businesses – part of the 263,116 small commercial registered consumers under the ERC – the utility firm must go back to the drawing board to ascertain how the new SMEs deal will affect revenues. “I direct the Energy Cabinet secretary to review electricity tariffs within one month and come up with a sustainable plan to ensure the cost of power to SMEs is brought down,” President Kenyatta said after attending a two-day SMEs forum last week. The changes came as a surprise to electricity distributor KP, which has been pushing for higher rates on increased operating costs, and citing the need for more funds to upgrade the network. The latest order comes even as other changes to payment structures made in August whereby ERC announced and initiated a new payment structure are being actualised after complaints about fluctuations in power bills from consumers. tickets.
