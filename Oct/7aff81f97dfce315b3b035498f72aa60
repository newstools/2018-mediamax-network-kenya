Paris, Tuesday @PeopleSports11 FIFA best player of the year Luka Modric remains on track for a second major award after he was named on Monday night among 30 nominees for the Ballon d’Or alongside the Juventus’ winger Cristiano Ronaldo, Barcelona’s Lionel Messi and Liverpool’s Mohamed Salah. Modric, a World Cup runner-up with Croatia, beat former Real Madrid team-mate Ronaldo and Salah to win the FIFA prize last month after Messi was surprisingly left off the final three-man list. Ronaldo, currently facing allegations of rape dating back to 2009 that he strenuously denies, has already won the Ballon d’Or five times and is the current holder of the award.  Messi has also won the award on five occasions. FIFA split from the Ballon d’Or in 2016 to launch its own set of awards. The winner of the prestigious Ballon d’Or organised by France Football magazine will be announced on December 3. Real Madrid and Wales forward Gareth Bale and Manchester City’s Belgium midfielder Kevin De Bruyne also featured among a list of familiar names. Bale, who scored two goals in Real’s triumph in the final of the Champions League against Liverpool including a spectacular overhead kick, is joined by club team-mates Karim Benzema, Raphael Varane, Isco, Marcelo and Sergio Ramos. De Bruyne was nominated for helping City win the Premier League and Belgium reach the World Cup semi-finals. Antoine Griezmann, a World Cup winner with France and Europa League champion at Atletico Madrid, is nominated alongside international team-mates, Chelsea midfielder N’Golo Kante, Manchester United’s Paul Pogba and PSG’s Kylian Mbappe. Eden Hazard gives Chelsea another player in the running after starring alongside De Bruyne at the World Cup, with England’s Golden Boot winner Harry Kane also included. Manchester City forward Sergio Aguero and PSG’s Neymar are nominated as are two other prolific South American strikers: Uruguayans Edinson Cavani of PSG and Luis Suarez of Barcelona.   -AFP
