Phase Two of the rehabilitation of Bukhungu Stadium that will see it elevated to become an international facility will start soon. President Uhuru Kenyatta and Kakamega County Governor Wycliffe Ambetsa Oparanya revealed this during Mashujaa Day celebrations on Saturday. Responding to Governor Oparanya’s request for the support to make the facility one of the best in the region, President Uhuru revealed the national government will partner with the county to ensure that rehabilitation work is complete. ‘’As I take this opportunity to congratulate our host governor for good job he has done to development and improve infrastructure that has seen transformation in this historic town I want to assure you our support especially on renovation on Bukhungu Stadium. “I am delighted to deliver my sixth Mashujaa Day address at this state-of-the-art Bukhungu Stadium that was recently renovated by the County government of Kakamega to the great standards we are enjoying, it is slated for further expansion as this is a true testimony of fruits of devolution,” President Uhuru pointed out. The President also reiterated the government’s efforts of recognizing the importance of sports in the country by honouring various sporting legends who included SportPesa Premier League (SPL) side Tusker coach Robert Matano, veteran youth coach and instructor Bob Oyugi, former Shabana striker Elijah Onsika and former 400m champion Rose Tata Muya. “Having realised the importance of this fast-growing industry we want to ensure that we improve on playing fields within the County with Bukhungu stadium remaining to be our main objective.”
