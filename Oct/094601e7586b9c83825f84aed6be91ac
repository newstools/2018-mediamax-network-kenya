Senate Committee on Health Monday toured West Pokot county on a fact finding mission, after area residents lodged complaints about the poor state of health in the county. The committee led by its chair who is also Trans Nzoia Senator Michael Mbito, said they decided to follow up on the allegations that had been presented before the house. Mbito thanked the county government for efficient utilisation of the funds they were getting from the National Government, however minimal, to ensure residents get quality services. Mbito highlighted that the county was offering quality services in spite of having the few personnel. Early this year residents from the county filed a petition to the senate over the deplorable state of health in the county, saying they had been short changed. In the petition, residents called for the immediate sacking of the area Deputy Governor who doubles up as the county executive committee member for health and still works as a neurosurgeon in America.
