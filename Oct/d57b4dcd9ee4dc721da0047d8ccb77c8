Problems in the sugar sector dominated yesterday’s meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and Western region leaders. Sources said the reconciliation initiative between the President and Opposition leader Raila Odinga was also part of the deliberations at State House, Nairobi. Coming just days before Mashujaa Day celebrations which will be held in Kakamega town, it is expected the government’s revival plan for the troubled Mumias Sugar Company, and the sugar sector in general, will be the highlight of the President’s speech. “The President promised to help revive Mumias Sugar because manufacturing is part of his Big Four agenda,” a legislator who attended the meeting said. The leaders are said to have asked the President to prioritise  payment of sugar cane farmers. Uhuru reportedly also assured the politicians that they are part of the national reconciliation symbolised by the March 9 Handshake between him and Raila. Nominated MP Godfrey Osotsi said the President had been emphatic on the issue of the Building Bridges initiative. “He said that it was a national  initiative and asked us to support it for the good of the country,” he said. Among the leaders who met the President were senate Speaker Ken Lusaka, governors Wycliffe Oparanya (Kakamega), Sospeter Ojaamong (Busia), Wilbur Ottichillo (Vihiga), Wycliffe Wangamati (Bungoma) and Patrick Khaemba (Trans Nzoia). Others were senators Moses Wetang’ula (Bungoma), Amos Wako (Busia) and George Khaniri (Vihiga). Sevaral MPs from the region were also present. Reportedly, ANC leader Musalia Mudavadi, sent apologies.
