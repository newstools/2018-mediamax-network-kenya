Anthony Mwangi  and Dinah Ondari @PeopleDailyKe Parliament wants Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’I, his Transport counterpart James Macharia and Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet held accountable for Wednesday’s accident. MPs and senators, who had adjourned business to mourn with the bereaved, expressed outrage over the road accident at Fort Ternan. “If I were the Transport CS I would have resigned yesterday,” said National Assembly Majority Whip Benjamin Washiali. The lawmakers asked President Uhuru Kenyatta to declare road carnage a national disaster with Makali Mulu (Kitui Central) questioning National Transport and Safety Authority’s (NTSA) role. Senators said most road accidents could be prevented and faulted State agencies involved in road safety enforcement for failing in their mandates. They also urged the public to act if  they find themselves in a vehicle manned by an undisciplined crew.
