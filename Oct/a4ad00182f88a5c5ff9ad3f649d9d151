The national government is working closely with counties to boost agriculture in the country. Speaking on Wednesday when he opened the Kitale ASK show, Agriculture Chief Administrative Secretary (CAS) Andrew Tuimur said the two levels of government were working to ensure farmers get the best skills and use modern technology to improve agriculture practices. “We have established a bull station that will give millions of semen, which will improve dairy farming,” he said, adding that the government would work to lower the cost of dairy feeds. He commended Trans Nzoia County government for working on programmes such as soil testing and subsidised fertiliser to improve production. He encouraged farmers to embrace water harvesting, saying the move would improve agriculture during dry seasons. At the same time, Kenya Seed Company managing director Azariah Soi has advised maize farmer to ignore leaders telling them to abandon the crop. Speaking at the ASK show, he said maize was the country’s staple food and a source of income, and farmers should be encouraged to plant more to achieve food security and improve on their livelihoods. He said the company has come up with new varieties such as 6219, which are resistant to diseases and pests and are high yielding. His comment comes amid fluctuating maize prices in the country with a 90kg bag going at Sh1,000. Farmers have also expressed concerns over delayed payments by the government. Trans Nzoia County government has been encouraging farmers to abandon maize farming and instead produce other cash crops such as macadamia and avocados, which Governor Patrick Khaemba said had ready market.
