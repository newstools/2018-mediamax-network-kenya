Former Football Kenya Federation (FKF) President Sam Nyamweya has cautioned Kenyans over being overly confident in Kenya beating Ethiopia in the 2019 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) qualifying match at Moi International Sports Centre (MISC) in Kasarani on Sunday. In a statement, Nyamweya said it is still premature to ascertain that Harambee Stars will make it to the continental showpiece to be held in Cameroon next year, adding that hard work and dedication by the home boys is paramount to realize this dream. Nyamweya pointed out that his attention is drawn into the match and especially the premature celebrations by Kenyan football fans. “This is a very important match in Kenya’s quest to qualify for Africa’s premier soccer showpiece for the first time in 15 years and it is understandable that the whole country is highly expectant. Many football fans are excited at the prospect of Stars qualifying for Cameroon 2019,” said Nyamweya. He added: “I have seen excitement growing amongst Kenyans with some getting carried away in a manner suggestive that qualification is a fore-gone conclusion especially with the decision by FIFA to suspend Sierra Leone. Kenyans must be cautious because in football anything can happen.”
