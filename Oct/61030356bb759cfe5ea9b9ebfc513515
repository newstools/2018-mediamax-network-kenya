The main suspects in the murder of businesswoman Monica Kimani– Joseph Kuria Irungu alias Jowie and journalist Jacque Maribe will be  remanded at the Industrial Area and Lang’ata women’s prisons respectively until Monday next week. Justice Jessie Lessit also granted the prosecution’s request to have Maribe undergo a mental assessment  at the Mathare Mental Hospital before she can be allowed to take plea. And as Grace Kuria reports, it was the priceless moment in court between Jacque Maribe and her father  that captured the attention of many Kenyans.
