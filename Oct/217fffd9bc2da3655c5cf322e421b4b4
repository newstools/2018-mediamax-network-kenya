Washington DC, Monday US President Donald Trump has accused climate change scientists of having a “political agenda” as he cast doubt on whether humans were responsible for the earth’s rising temperatures. But Trump said he no longer believed climate change was a hoax. The comments, made during an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes, come less than a week after climate scientists issued a final call to halt rising temperatures. The world’s leading scientists agree that climate change is human-induced. Last week’s report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) — the leading international body evaluating climate change — warned the world was heading towards a temperature rise of 3°C. Scientists say that natural fluctuations in temperature are being exacerbated by human activity – which has caused approximately 1°C of global warming above pre-industrial levels. The report said keeping to the preferred target of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels will mean “rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society”. During Sunday’s interview, Trump cast doubt on making any changes, saying the scientists “have a very big political agenda”. “I don’t think it’s a hoax, I think there’s probably a difference,” he told journalist Lesley Stahl. “But I don’t know that it’s manmade. I will say this. I don’t want to give trillions of dollars. I don’t want to lose millions of jobs. I don’t want to be put at a disadvantage.” Trump added that temperatures “could very well go back” – although he did not say how. He said climate change was a hoax during his election campaign in 2016 but has generally avoided taking a clear stance on the issue since taking office. —BBC
