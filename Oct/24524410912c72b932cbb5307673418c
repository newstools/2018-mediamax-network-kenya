PSCU @PeopleDailyKe Kenya will not pull its soldiers out of Somalia until the troubled country achieves peace, stability and security, President Uhuru Kenyatta declared yesterday. He said the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) would continue to operate under AMISOM until all terror networks in Somalia are neutralised. “We shall continue our presence in the country until the restoration of full security in  Somalia,” said the President Kenyatta during the seventh annual KDF Day at Kenyatta Barracks in Gilgil, Nakuru. KDF Day is marked to commemorate Kenya’s fallen heroes and heroines who died in line of duty. Uhuru said Kenyans appreciate role played by KDF in security operations and peace initiatives in the region, especially in war on terrorism. He said Kenya cannot let down its guard until the complex transnational terror networks operating in the Horn of Africa region are obliterated. Earlier, the President opened a Sh3.8 billion KDF  food  agro-processing  factory in the Kenyatta barracks.
