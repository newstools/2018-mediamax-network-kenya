Jericho All Stars were formally presented with a trophy and a cheque of Sh500,000 by Super 8 Premier League organisers, Extreme Sports Limited in a colourful coronation ceremony held at a fully packed Camp Toyoyo Grounds at the weekend. The East Conference side and the newly crowned champions, put up a brilliant performance to down arch-rivals Makadara Junior League 2-0 in a nail-biting neighbourhood derby to lift their first Super 8 title on their third attempt. After an exemplary season, Jericho dethrone Kawangware United after registering 20 wins and 8 draws to top the 16-team log with 69 points from 30 competitive matches. Extreme’s, Head of Operations and Coordination, Athanas Obango, appealed for more sponsors to come on board citing massive talent will be nurtured and thus the league will act as a breeding centre for talent in the nation. “We have had a brilliant league this season, teams have shown great commitment and showed up for their match in time. We have been having challenges since the departure of our title sponsor last year because it’s quite difficult to run the three tier leagues without any assistance. We are requesting well-wishers and corporates in the country to join us in supporting grassroots football and youth mentorship through sports,” said Obango. “We are still grateful for overwhelming fans who showed up at the finals, it means a lot for us because it means they still believe in us and our league. We had lacked the vibrant fans for quite a while but we are glad they turned up to show massive support for the local teams. Lastly, the government should put up more grounds in Nairobi estates to ease congestion of matches,” he said. Jericho’s top scorer, Kelvin Ndung’u with 24 goals stated this season the changes they made in the beginning of season paid off.
