The main suspects in the Monica Kimani murder Joseph Kuria alias Jowie and TV reporter Jacque Maribe will remain in remand at the Industrial Area and Lang’ata prisons respectively, after pleading not guilty to  murder charges preferred against them. The two will be arraigned  on Wednesday before a different  judge after Judge Jessie Lessit recused herself and ordered they be arraigned Wednesday to set a date for their bail application.
