Fast-rising Mombasa-based singer, Pamela Anyango aka Pamkuls, is pissed off by people likening her to fellow singer Akothee. In an interview with the Spice, the artiste and mother of two divulged that although her resemblance (especially vocally) to the Give It To Me hitmaker has got her out of otherwise nasty situations, she’s not happy with it. “It only takes me to utter a few words and people are all over asking whether I am Akothee. Not that I hate her, but it is annoying when people start mistaking our vocal similarities. What I can say is I am my own person, doing my own thing,” she said. Pamkuls, who also doubles as a fashion designer, intimated that motherhood has made her a better person as the musical acceptance she enjoys everywhere else started back at home. She says: “My children are my number one fans. They cheer me on. And it’s out of such encouragement that I get inspiration to do what I do out there with confidence. Motherhood has taught me to be even more responsible knowing that everything I do would have effects on my children.” At the same time, the singer who has just released a new song titled Lovi Lovi, intimated that female artistes in Kenya still don’t have a level playing ground with their male counterparts, with sexual exploitation taking toll on vulnerable rookies. “One of the main reasons we don’t have a lot of female artistes in the local music industry is the prevalent sexual exploitation meted out on them by industry players. From producers to deejays and media personalities, especially TV and radio presenters, they propagate these vice against female artistes while giving false promises of airtime and what not. Upcoming female artistes are in the high-risk area in this. This has to change if we need this industry to progress and produce artistes of repute,” says Pamkuls. The singer is known for her other songs including Kenya, Juicy Dance and Hutosheki.
