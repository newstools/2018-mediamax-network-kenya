The stand-off over the Ndakaini dam water supply intensified Thursday with Nairobi Governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko telling off his  Murang’a counterpart Mwangi Wa Iria over his demands for a 25% share of revenues generated from the resource. Speaking at the ASK Nairobi showground, Sonko accused his counterpart of  politicising  the matter insisting water was a national resource saying the Nairobi county government legally owns the Ndakaini dam. He spoke as day after water Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui issued a similar warning  to Murang’a leaders.
