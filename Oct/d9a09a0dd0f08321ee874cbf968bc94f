The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) Noordin Haji has dismissed claims by lawyer Charles Kanjama that the attempted murder case of former Garissa Finance executive Idris Mukhtar is being politically influenced. In response to Kanjama’s letter dated October 15, Haji said he was not aware of any political interests in the case. “Kanjama has alluded to political pressure and alleged negotiations between Mukhtar’s family and the suspects. The two are not matters that would guide or influence us in deciding to prosecute,” he said. “You are expected to bear true fidelity to the law and avoid casting aspersions and insinuations without factual or legal basis,” he told Kanjama. Haji said he has not received the investigation report from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations as claimed by Kanjama. Mukhtar’s family had expressed fears that the case could stall over political influence.
