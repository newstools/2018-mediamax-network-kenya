George Kebaso @Morarak A new report on climate change has warned that the world is heading towards a catastrophe if immediate action is not taken to halt greenhouse gas emissions. Developing countries including Kenya are the most affected and have under 12 years to achieve that. The Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change (IPCC) report released during  a climate summit in South Korea on Monday was a major point of discussion yesterday at the official opening of the national climate governance conference in Nairobi where speakers reinforced the findings. Officer in Charge of the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa’s (Uneca) Africa Climate Policy Centre (ACPC) James Murombedzi said the report confirms that Africa is already experiencing a quickly changing climate than previously predicted. “Climate change is happening at a rate much faster than previously estimated. Global warming is outstripping all our efforts to resolve it. The impact of global warming are also already much greater than predicted, particularly in developing countries,” he said. However, to avoid passing the 1.5 degrees threshold agreed in Paris, France in 2015, he said there is need to reduce emissions by 45 per cent by 2030. Despite aligning her laws to a number of international legal frameworks designed to address climate change, Kenya feels that access to climate finance is still a major challenge. “As you are aware, access to climate finance — especially in form of grants —  is a challenge, for implementation of climate change actions,” Environment Cabinet secretary Keriako Tobiko said.
