Mombasa residents want the county government to introduce and enforce laws banning smoking in public places. The residents accused the county government of failing to enforce the Tobacco Control Act, 2007, which has largely contributed to the uncontrolled smoking in the tourist town. A spot check by the media showed that many people were smoking freely in the streets and bus stages in total disregard of non-smokers. Mombasa does not have public designated smoking areas, those available are found at Moi International Airport, hotels and other private social places. Many residents interviewed on the issue underscored the need to protect non-smokers, including children, saying public smoking was rampant in the area. Jalade Ashraph, a medical practitioner, said tobacco use is one of the main risk factors for many chronic diseases in the area. “The county government should not only outlaw smoking in public but also usage of tobacco completely,” he said, adding that smokers and non-smokers are equally exposed to serious cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, including coronary heart disease and lung cancer. “Strict laws must be introduced to protect members of the public from tobacco-related diseases. 12,000 Kenyans are killed from tobacco-related illness yearly,” he added. Council of Imams and Preachers of Kenya (CIPK) organising secretary Sheikh Mohamed Khalifa urged the County Assembly to  introduce a bill to restrict public smoking to save the county from increased cases of tobacco-related deaths. The Global Burden of Disease Report said in Kenya, non-communicable diseases related to tobacco use accounted for about 29 per cent of all mortality.
