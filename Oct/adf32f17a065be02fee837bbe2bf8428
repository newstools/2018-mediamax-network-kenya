The Senate ad hoc Committee on Maize yesterday discovered tonnes of expired seeds at Nyamira National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) depot that should have benefited area farmers. The senators were touring the county on a fact-finding mission on the state of maize farming in the region. Area Governor John Nyagarama expressed shock over the discovery, saying it was criminal to deny farmers seeds. He and his Agriculture executive Peris Mong’are could not explain why the maize and beans seeds had been left to go bad after being stored for more than five years. The committee also discovered 1,500 fertiliser bags of 50kg each that were stocked long after the planting season. The findings come after farmers accused the government of not doing enough to provide subsidised farm inputs. “We follow very long processes to get planting materials,” said Geoffrey Nyakundi, a farmer in Borabu sub-county. Committee chairperson Margaret Kamar said there was need for a centralised system of registering farmers and it should be a one-off exercise. Nyagarama said his government was  focused on diversifying area crops especially after massive failure of maize because of the viral lethal Necrosis Disease. West Mugirango MP Vincent Kemosi said there was need to decentralise NCBP to other parts of the county to enable farmers to access subsidised farm inputs.
