The number of people killed and injured in road accidents in Kenya by October 14, this year went up by 16.34 per cent compared with the same period in 2017. Statistics issued by the National Transport and Safety Authority (NTSA) show that the number of victims increased from 8,743 in October 2017 to 10,172, this year. Director General Francis MejaÂ said 273 black spots have been identified nationally, with 199 in the Northern Corridor and 74 in Nairobi. The black spots have increased from 166 in 2013. According to the road safety authority, increased road carnage, has partly been caused by inadequate footbridges and crossing points and failure to observe traffic rules by both motorists and pedestrians. Boda boda riders have also been put on the spot. They have been faulted for causing accidents, ignoring traffic rules and being involved in crime-related activities. Meja added that the number of boda boda passengers killed has sustained an upward trend with an increase of 8.24 per cent compared to 2017. By October 14, 2018, 193 boda boda passengers had died compared to 178 who lost their lives in the same period last year. Similarly, fatalities of motorcycle riders have increased from 374 cases last year to the current 444. The data by NTSA added that pedestrians accounted for the highest number of those killed on the roads with 925 deaths reported, followed by passengers at 593 and drivers at 244.
