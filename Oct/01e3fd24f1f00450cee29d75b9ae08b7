Irene Githinji @gitshee Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) secretary general Wilson Sossion yesterday said they have no intention of disrupting the national examinations to have their grievances addressed. He assured they are not at war with the exam candidates and teachers will supervise and mark the tests as scheduled and the exercise will continue uninterrupted. He said their ultimatum to Teachers Service Commission (TSC) to call a meeting to address their grievances expired last night after which they will not make further reference to the employer  on their next move. But even as he assured that teachers will not disrupt writing of national examinations, the nominated MP said the strike option remains firmly in place though this can only happen when schools re-open for first term next year. “Schools are now closing and workers do not strike when they are on holiday. We now switch to holiday mood and consider the option on whether schools will open in January or not if our issues are not addressed. If there is no action by TSC by midnight today, we will stop dealing with them,” Sossion told The People Daily on phone. He said Knut cannot call a strike at the moment because a procedure for it has been clearly set out, which includes the union’s National Executive Council (NEC) taking the necessary decision and deliberating on it. Knut’s NEC is responsible for policy issues, which then reports to the Annual Delegates Conference (ADC).
