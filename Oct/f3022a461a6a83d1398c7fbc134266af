Chaos rocked Kisumu County Assembly yesterday following a protracted fight between MCAs and the chief Sergeant-at-arms George Amayo. Amayo was forced to fire in the air to scare away some MCAs, who were baying for his blood after he invited police officers to the Assembly to reportedly assess damage to property caused as MCAs protested a move to suspend the session. The Ward Reps shouted at the police officers forcing them to retreat and then they went after Amayo. He was escorted by police officers to leave the Assembly but some members of the public also wanted to attack him and pelted him with stones. He recorderd a statement at Kisumu Central Police Station together with some MCAs. The fracas was triggered by MCAs disagreement over an adjournment of the Assembly sitting, which was presided over by temporary Speaker Eric Agola Leader of Majority Kenneth Onyango termed the indefinite adjournment unprocedural. “As a matter of procedure an adjournment motion must be moved and adopted by members to guarantee the suspension of Assembly sittings,” he said. He said the Assembly could not afford to adjourn as MCAs had many pending bills to legislate. Onyango accused Assembly Speaker Onyango Oloo of mismanaging the House and asked ODM party to intervene. His sentiments were echoed by Kisumu North MCA Elisha Oraro.
