The government has set aside Sh2 billion to instal power in rural homes in Nakuru county under the Last Mile Connectivity project. Addressing the press after lighting several homes in Maraigushu village in Naivasha, Energy Cabinet secretary Charles Keter said homes under the project will be connected in the next two weeks. Keter said they were committed to ensuring rural households were connected to power as one way of fulfilling pledges made by Jubilee Party last year. “The cost of connecting rural homes in Naivasha is estimated at Sh200 million. We are committed to ensuring all homes are connected to electricity so that we stop over-reliance on tin lamps,” said Keter. He added that shopping centres will also be connected to enable residents and traders to engage in business even after dusk. “All centres along this highway including Ihindu, Fly Over, Karai and Kinungi will be connected so that Kenyans can perform their duties as is the case in other areas,” he said. Nakuru deputy governor Eric Korir termed the initiative as the way to go for economic and social empowerment for residents. “The Last Mile Connectivity project will boost economic growth and a borehole recently suck will also be connected to provide water for residents,” he said.
