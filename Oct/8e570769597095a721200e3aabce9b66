Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu) has asked a Nairobi court seeking to compel Labour Cabinet secretary to reappoint and gazette Francis Atwoli as the organisation’s nominee to the National Social Security Fund (NSSF) board of trustees. Cotu accused CS Ukur Yattani of failing to reappoint and gazette Atwoli to the NSSF board despite the matter being brought to his attention in a letter dated August 13. Through lawyer Okweh Achiando, Cotu argues that the board will continue to meet over various issues such as financial reports, approval of major projects, job advertisements, interviews and appointment of  general managers of various NSSF departments without Atwoli’s input. “Convening such meetings to consider various issues in the absence of the Cotu nominee is prejudicial to the interest of Atwoli,” said Achiando in documents filed at the Labour and Industrial Relations Court in Milimani yesterday. Cotu wants Yattani and the NSSF board restrained from convening any meetings pending Atwol’s reappointment and gazettement. Cotu argues that the refusal, neglect and failure to reappoint and gazette Atwoli is a gross violation of Atwoli’s fundamental constitutional rights and freedoms. In an affidavit by Atwoli, Cotu said Yattani’s actions are against the provisions of the law and should not be allowed to frustrate a legal rights conferred to the workers’ body. “I aver that there is real fear that the meetings convened by the board are illegal as they are conducted without my participation,” said Atwoli.
