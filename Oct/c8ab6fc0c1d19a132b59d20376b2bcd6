Bottom-placed Kayole Asubuhi became the first team to be relegated from the Super 8 Premier League after playing to a 1-1 draw with newly-crowned Jericho All Stars at Calvary grounds at the weekend. With one match remaining, the result means Asubuhi, with 27 points, cannot surpass their closest East Conference rivals Shauri Moyo Blue Stars who have 32 points and lie 12th on the 16-team log. Shauri Moyo improved their survival quest after a hard-fought 1-0 win over fellow relegation candidates RYSA. Both teams had languished at the bottom of the log for the better part of the season, managing only six wins, nine draws and 14 losses in the 29 matches they have played. In their heated match against the champions Jericho, Kayole scored first through Godwin Sematimba’s well-taken penalty in the 28th minute but Jericho equalised after 66 minutes through top scorer Kelvin Ndung’u, condemning the 2016 winners to second-tier Super 8 Division One. “It has been a tough season because we have been rebuilding this team. We brought in several players so the challenge was getting the team to blend but unfortunately it is too late,” said Kayole coach Isaiah Omondi. He added: “The players gave their all and we will go back to the drawing board and rectify our shortcomings as we hope to make a come back.”
