San Fransisco, Wednesday @PeopleSports11 Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant accepted their championship rings Tuesday for leading Golden State to a third NBA title in four campaigns, then powered the Warriors over Oklahoma City 108-100 in their 2018-19 season opener. Curry scored 32 points with nine assists and eight rebounds while Durant had 27 points, eight rebounds and six assists as the Warriors held off a fourth-quarter fightback to make a triumphant launch to their quest for a third consecutive crown. “The first game could go either way with timing and overall execution. We had a terrible third quarter but we withstood the run and were able to get the job done,” Curry said. He added: “We’ve got to take care of the ball better. That will come with more possessions as we get through the season. We know what’s at stake. Winning three in a row would put us in some very select company. We’re not shy talking about it. But you have to do the little things throughout the season. I think we’re ready for it.” The first game of the NBA season was in Boston, where Jayson Tatum scored 23 points and grabbed nine rebounds while reserve Marcus Morris added 16 points and 10 rebounds as the host Celtics ripped Philadelphia 105-87. But the night’s highlight came when NBA commissioner Adam Silver handed out championship jewellery, Golden State’s Steve Kerr taking his fourth as a coach to go with four he won as a player, and praised the Warriors dynasty for far more than on-court skills. “The Warriors have a tradition of excellence based on universal values like teamwork, respect and unity,” Silver said.
