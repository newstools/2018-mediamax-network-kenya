Roy Lumbe @lumbe_roy Supermarkets in Nakuru county have rejected a petition by businessman Hezron Manyara seeking to restrain them from selling fresh produce. Choppies Stores manager Peter Mukiri said yesterday Kenya is a liberalised economy and people have freedom to buy and sell goods where they want. He urged the Assembly to throw out the petition, saying the proposal, if passed will discourage investors and impoverish small-scale traders. “The petition is aimed at curtailing supermarkets and it is of no use to customers. There are customers who prefer shopping at the markets and some at the supermarkets and you cannot change that,”  he said. In the petition, Manyara wants  all supermarkets in the county barred from selling fresh produce to protect small-scale traders from exploitation by the mega stores. The petition has received huge support from Wakulima Market  traders who say supermarkets have eaten into their market share.
