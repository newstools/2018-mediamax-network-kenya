Barry Silah @obel_barry Nakumatt FC may have secured another season in the SportPesa Premier League but they may kick off the new season without the coach that has ensured their survival and a number of players. This is after coach Melis Medo said he is weighing his options after going for months without pay. “I have offers on the table. I will study them and consult widely. I need to get paid for services that I provide and if Nakumatt cannot do that, then too bad,” said Medo immediately after his team’s 2-0 win in the promotion playoff second leg against Ushuru at Kasarani Stadium on Sunday. The American tactician joined the club in June and has expressed his displeasure with the club’s management over salary arrears amounting to four months for both the technical bench and playing unit, blaming it on the team’s poor run that almost saw them relegated from the top flight There have also been reports of a rift between Medo and his assistant Francis Mwangi who are said not see eye-to-eye because of their different qualification levels. Medo, who was recently linked with the AFC Leopards job before Ingwe hired Serbian Nicola Kavazovic last weekend, saw his team win 1-0 in the first leg before Joseph Waithira’s brace completed the rout on Sunday. “This is a good unit which if kept together can go places. However, they need motivation because they need to feed. Something must give or the club could lose its key assets. Indeed, 35 of the workers at Nakumatt FC deserve better because it has been a struggle,” added Medo, who singled out Boniface Wafula, Waithira and John Avire for praise after playing a key role in the win despite having little top flight experience. Waithira was recruited from Wazito FC in 2017 when they were still in the second tier National Super League (NSL) while Avire had spent most time on the bench at Bandari before joining Nakumatt. The team finished 16th in the 2018 campaign, necessitating a play-off with Ushuru who were third in the NSL.
