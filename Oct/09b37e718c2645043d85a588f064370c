Narok North Member of Parliament  Moitalel ole Kenta has lent his support for constitutional review to create inclusivity in leadership. The Maa legislator says the creation of a Prime Minister’s post and deputy Prime Minister slots will  give marginalized communities a chance to be represented in the senior levels of government. Inclusivity in government was one of the key reform agenda’s in President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga’s handshake package.
