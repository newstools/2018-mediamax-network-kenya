The National Land Commission has begun enquiries and investigations into the controversial public land within the Jimba Settlement Scheme in Kilifi county. The four day exercise is meant to identify genuine land owners in about 500 parcels of prime land within the settlement scheme, with a view to lift an embargo that was put in place by the government in 1987 following claims of massive land grabbing and illegal allocations.
