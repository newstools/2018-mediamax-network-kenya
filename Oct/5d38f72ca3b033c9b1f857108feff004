Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi has called for the dissolution of one House of Parliament as a way of reducing government expenditure. The MP, who is the chairman of the National Assembly’s Public Accounts Committee, said the country cannot afford a bicameral Parliament and Kenyans should decide to do away with either the National Assembly or the Senate. Speaking on Saturday at Gondho village in Ugunja sub-county, Siaya during a funeral, Wandayi said the cost of running the government is too heavy for Kenyans. “We must review the government structure which is too heavy,” he said, adding that Kenyans are over-represented.
