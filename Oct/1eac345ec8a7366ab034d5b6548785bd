MPs want Inspector General of Police Joseph Boinnet to step aside for alleged failure to contain road carnage. They also want the police boss to take responsibility for the death of 58 people in the recent road accident at Fort Ternan in Kericho. When he appeared before the National Assembly’s Transport yesterday, Boinnet was hard-pressed to explain why traffic police along highways failed to impound the ill-fated bus yet it had no licence to operate at  night, nor an insurance certificate. But he defended the officers, saying they cannot be in all highways all the time. “Our officers are, however, trying to ensure there is safety on the roads,” said Boinnet. MPs Peris Tobiko and Tom Ondege wondered why Boinnet had not stepped aside over the accident, but the IG said investigations were underway.
