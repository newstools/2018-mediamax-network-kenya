Police in Nairobi have arrested a close ally of Joseph Irungu, alias Jowi, the main suspect in the  Monica Kimani murder. Okoth Orlando, also known as Jennings Odhiambo, is said to have been with Irungu on the night Monica was murdered at her Lamuria Gardens apartment in Kilimani, Nairobi on September 19. A WhatsApp message that has widely been circulated read, “Okoth Orlando (am assuming ni Jennings) was arrested jana usiku within Nairobi over the ongoing probe into Monica murder.” Police are said to have conducted an identification parade that bore positive results early Friday morning at Muthaiga Police Station. “I don’t know by who but sources say two witnesses identified him,” the message read further. It is reported that Orlando was taken to Muthaiga Police Station where he spent the night before being taken to Kiambu Law Courts where police were given 14 days to detain him. “He was then taken to DCI Homicide Unit for interrogation . Saa hii wako (now he is at) GSU Recce Squad Quarters,” the message reads. He was one of the GSU Recce officers attached to the US Embassy. Since the arrest of Jowi, and subsequent identification and interrogation, it has been widely reported that he was captured on CCTV cameras with another person in Citizen TV news anchor, Jacque Maribe’s car as he drove from Kilimani area on the day the woman died. Earlier reports indicated that Jennings had fled the country and into Tanzania. He made a stop in Mombasa where DCI detectives camped for a couple of days. It is here that he allegedly sought ‘cleansing’ services from a witchdoctor. From pieces of police investigations, it is also believed that Jowi was at Road House Grill together with Jennings.
