Steve Umidha @steveumidha Omani investors have expressed interest in investing Kenya’s key sectors anchored under the “Big Four” plan. The economic development plan being championed by President Uhuru Kenyatta include food security, affordable housing, manufacturing and universal healthcare. Minister for Trade and Industry Ali Masoud Al Sunaida, who is leading a delegation of more than 80 investors in the country to scout for business opportunities, said yesterday the team will keenly focus on the four sectors in an effort to boost trade ties, while at the same time complementing Kenya’s efforts in realising the “Big Four” dream. “We already have some deals in the pipeline we hope can be concluded during this period, but we are keen on sectors touching on the Big Four that Kenya is hopeful to achieve,” he said. The investors are in the country for the inaugural Oman Product Expo that has attracted business executives of more than 100 firms from the sultanate. The firms will showcase their wares during the four-day event, with the trade fair seeking to connect Kenyan agro-processors, manufacturers, contractors, distributors, exporters and importers with their counterparts from Oman. The trade fair which ends tomorrow will also provide a platform for companies from both countries to sign joint ventures partnerships as well as a memorandum of understanding. Talks between the two nations to ratify double taxation whose outcomes are expected to see respective firms are not overburdened by heavy taxes are also underway. The move according to Kiprono Kittony, the Chairperson of Kenya National Chamber of Commerce and Industry, could triple trade between the countries.
