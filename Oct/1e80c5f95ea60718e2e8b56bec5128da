Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Tales of loss of funds and mismanagement at the National Youth Service (NYS) could be a thing of the past if a bill proposing changes at the agency sails through in Parliament. Public Service, Youth and Gender Cabinet secretary Margaret Kobia (left) said yesterday the bill seeks to strengthen NYS and restructure it to instil clear internal control structures, among them an auditor to track the usage of public funds. She said the National Youth Service Bill 2018, drafted by a multi-agency taskforce formed early this year proposes the creation of  a council within NYS to provide the necessary governance for efficient service delivery. “We are establishing a council to ensure improved governance structure in terms of its finances,” said Kobia. The CS said the ministry is currently working with a local audit firm—PriceWaterhouseCoopers—to monitor procurement and ensure regulations are complied with. “Passage of the bill will give a  clear segregation of duties at the service with the council taking charge of supervision from the Principal secretary as the ministry deals with formulation of policies,” she added. “You know, corruption has been rampant at NYS because only the PS is supposed to oversight the director general. That is why whenever there has been a scandal, the PS and the DG are always been suspended.” The bill is currently in the public participation stage.
