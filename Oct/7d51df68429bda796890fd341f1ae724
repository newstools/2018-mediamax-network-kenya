Dickens Wasonga @PeopleDailyKe Six Kakamega Members of County Assembly (MCAs) have snubbed summons  by Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) over corruption claims in the Assembly. EACC Western region deputy manager Aura Chibole  yesterday told People Daily that the Speaker Morris Buluma and the Clerk Patrick Wafula have already recorded statements. Those summoned include the Leader of Majority, Minority Whip and chairmen of various committees. On Wednesday, chaos erupted in the Assembly as MCAs impeached Buluma and Wafula for failing to approve their mortgage and allegedly using county funds for personal gain. Sango Ward MCA Kennedy Shitanda was elected acting Speaker.
