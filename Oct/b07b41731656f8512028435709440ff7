DPPS Deputy President William Ruto has asked universities and other institutions of higher learning to focus more on research and innovation to spearhead development. The DP  told universities to shift attention to research that could add value to the growth and development of the country. Speaking during the launch of Embu University Endowment Fund at the institution’s grounds yesterday,  Ruto said it was through research that learning institutions could offer programmes that can provide solutions to challenges facing the country. “No country can be developed without research and innovation. We must, therefore, focus more on science and technology,” he said. Ruto, at the same time, said State funding to universities would be allocated based on student population and courses offered. “It is time universities and institutions of higher learning focus less on numbers and more on relevance and quality of courses offered especially at a time when we have limited resources and competing priorities,” he said. Ruto said universities must align their courses to the job market and national economic development agenda. “We must be concerned about relevance of courses we offer and the quality of graduates we produce,” he added.
