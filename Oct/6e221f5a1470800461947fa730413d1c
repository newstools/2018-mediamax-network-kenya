Barry Silah @obel_barry With slightly under a month to go for the ICC World Cricket League Division Three Qualifiers to take effect in Oman, Kenya is still grappling with endless wrangles. The latest dose to the drama was witnessed on Friday following a travelling team list to Oman which instantly drew the ire of many cricket lovers. Two experienced bowlers in the shape of Lucas Oluoch and Elijah Otieno were left out unceremoniously by the selectors which shocked pundits in the game. At the same time, Stray Lions player Shem Ngoche (left) who has been captain for about six months lost his armband in unclear circumstances. Top performers like medium pace bowler Martin Okoth of Nairobi Gymkhana and Neer Dave of champions Kanbis were also overlooked despite having decent innings in the recently concluded Super Elite Championships. Youngster Gerald Mwendwa has however earned a maiden call-up to the senior team. However the most intriguing bit that has left a sour taste in the mouth of many was the elevation of David Obuya as coach assisted by Lameck Onyango while Obuya’s junior kin Collins Omondi is now the Captain of the Oman tour. Maurice Odumbe seems to have been booted out cold as the new team shapes up. Critics have accused the selectors of being biased and have demanded integrity. Obuya, secretary to the government backed Interim Management Committee (IMC), is amongst the best trainers in the country having earned his Level 3 certification from Hong Kong. Obuya Academy All-rounder Collins Omondi had been once skipper of the national team but was sacked following allegations of indiscipline. Already beef is brewing between former players and officials engaging in dangerous personalised attacks while a handicapped Cricket Kenya office seem powerless. The Interim Committee itself has been roundly accused of holding the game at ransom. Critics believe IMC has succeeded in only worsening the status of the game recently because of ego wars.
