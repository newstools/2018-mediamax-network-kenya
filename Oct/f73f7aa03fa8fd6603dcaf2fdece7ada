Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko has dismissed Kericho Senator Aaron Cheruiyot calls to dissolve Nairobi City County. He asked the senator to stop abusing constitutional provisions that created the county. He said he will not allow the Senator and a few other individuals with a hidden agenda  to interfere with the County of Nairobi. “Article 96 of the Constitution empowers senators to have oversight responsibilities over all State officers but again, I think the senator did not consider that they are supposed to protect the interest of devolution and interest of all the counties,” he said. Sonko said it is within Cheruiyot’s democratic right to comment whatever he wants but should respect Nairobi. Speaking at Maji House yesterday, the governor said dissolving Nairobi requires a referendum. On Wednesday, the Kericho Senator shocked Nairobians and the country when he announced that he had drafted a proposal to have Nairobi County delisted as one of the 47 devolved units. He has also proposed that the name capital City be replaced by the name National Capital City.
