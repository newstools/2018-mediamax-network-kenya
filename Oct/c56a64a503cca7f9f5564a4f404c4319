Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho The Capital Markets Authority (CMA) has approved cross-listing by introduction of Bank of Kigali Group Plc (BK) on the Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE). The firm was listed on the Rwanda Stock Exchange (RSE) in 2011 through an Initial Public Offer. It’s a holding company of Bank of Kigali Plc, BK Insurance, BK Capital and BKTecHouse. CMA chief executive Paul Muthaura lauded the move, saying the listing fosters progress towards the development of the East African Community single market in financial services. Muthaura, who also serves as the chairman of the East African Securities Regulatory Authorities, said that cross-listing will facilitate cross-border investments, further strengthening the memorandum of understanding entered into between capital markets regulators in Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi. “It fosters a common blueprint on the integration of the East African capital markets. It will further enhance Kenya’s position as an international financial centre and gateway for regional and international capital flows,” he said. The cross-listing on the NSE is expected to address challenges BK Group faces in Rwanda, due to the small size of their capital market, by unlocking liquidity constraints and providing access to a wider pool of investors. Investors are expected to benefit from the opportunity to participate in the diverse income streams of BK Group and its future capital growth.
