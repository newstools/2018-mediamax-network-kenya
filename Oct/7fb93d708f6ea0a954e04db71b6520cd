Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi North Horr MP Francis Chachu and his Saku counterpart Dido Ali were yesterday released on bail over the Marsabit clashes that claimed 14 lives. Nairobi Senior principal magistrate Kennedy Cheruyiot released the two, who were arrested on Monday, on a Sh250,000 cash bail or a Sh1 million bond pending completion of investigations by police. The prosecution wanted the lawmakers detained at Kileleshwa Police Station for 21 days for Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) to complete investigations into the alleged incitement to violence between the Borana and Gabra communities. However, Cheruiyot ruled that there were no compelling reasons to deny the two bail. He directed them to report once a week before the DCI after their release. “I release them on bail so that they can continue with reconciliation process between the two communities,” he ruled. The prosecution had expressed fears that the accused will interfere with investigations if released.
