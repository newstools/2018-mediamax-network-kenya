The agriculture  sector must be fully devolved  to  rid it of management gaps   that  now threaten the country’s  economic mainstay. Nandi Governor Stephen Sang said this in reference to the maize farming situation that has seen many farmers go without pay and tonnes of the crop  rot in stores. Sang is now calling on the national government to empower  county governments to manage the sector saying the counties were already doing the bulk of the work and were better placed in managing it.
