President Uhuru Kenyatta today admitted his government’s failure to deliver on its pledges to the small and medium sized enterprises stating that most challenges facing the sector were minor but none had been addressed. Speaking  during a round table meeting  with SME  sector players at Strathmore university, the president said the government will hold a similar forum within two months after addressing some of the outstanding pledges to the sector.
