Jackline Nzisa @jackie_nzisa Fishing activities in the Indian Ocean have been hampered by strong winds and high tides that have hit the Coast region. Fishermen said yesterday they are unable to venture into deep sea due to the strong tides occasioned by wind blowing from South to South-east. “Since Monday, our fishing expeditions have been hampered, we are unable to venture into the sea due to the high tides. Our fishing boats are small and cannot withstand the currents,” said one of the fishermen, Swaleh Bakari. Kenya Meteorological Department has already issued warning to fishermen using small crafts to avoid navigating in the adverse weather condition The weatherman said the coastal region will experience strong winds with speed of between 15 and 24 knots and of gusts of around 33 knots. Strong winds are expected to coincide with heavy downpour of more than 30mm in 24 hours. Heavy rain were witnessed in Mombasa, Kwale, Kilifi, Tana River and Lamu for the better part of Wednesday. The meteorologists warned that the sea will have wave heights of between six and seven feet near the shore with occasional seas of up to 12 feet. The waves will be nine to 12 feet high offshore with occasional seas of up to 15 feet. Bakari said despite of the strong tides, some of the fishermen with small crafts were still risking their lives to get daily bread for their family. “When weather changes like this, we risk our lives because we have families to provide for, that is why we are pleading with the county government to provide us with for equipment for deep sea fishing and protection while we are fishing,” he said.
