Athletics Kenya (AK) Nyanza North branch chairman Joseph Ochieng has asked Kisumu County government to improve the track at its Moi Stadium. Ochieng challenged the county leadership to engage athletics officials before embarking on the renovation exercise to advise on the required international standards for athletics tracks. Ochieng said improved facilities will be key to talent development and empowerment among the aspiring youths and sprinters. He regretted that Nyanza North does not have a proper training facility apart from Sangoro Athletics Camp. “As a region we need to have different training grounds moved closer to participants and spread all over the region. As we speak that is not the case,” he said. He added: “Kisumu is the only place which has been hosting regional competitions yet we do not have properly marked tracks that meets the IAAF standards.” Kisumu county through its sports department had earlier indicated that the County government intended to embark on a renovation exercise that will see the facility acquiring FIFA standards. Kisumu County sports director Kenneth Otieno the exercise will approximately cost the county Sh100,000,000. This he said will be raised through private partnership with the county. The idea might however, fail to kick off as schedule since the county allocated only a paltry Sh40,000,000 to sports. Ochieng said once the facility is fitted with proper tracks it will boast runners participation in the region that prides her self with producing best sprinters. “We need to have this facilities to enable us boast standards of athletics in Nyanza region.  This is a region with potential sprinters but lack of training facilities has been a problem,” he said.
