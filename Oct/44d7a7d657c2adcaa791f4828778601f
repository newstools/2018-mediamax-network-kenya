Seth Mwaniki @mwanikim Kieni MP Kanini Kega has urged the National government to rethink the digital literacy programme. He said the programme, meant to provide Standard One pupils with laptops is counterproductive because it denies learners in other classes a chance to learn using the gadgets. Kega said in its place, the government should build and equip computer laboratories in schools to give all learners equal opportunity.“I am of the view that the programme has failed to achieve the intended purpose. The government should review it,” he said. The programme that was rolled out in July last year has only seen laptops distributed to Class One pupils then but it never continued with learners who joined Class One this year. He spoke yesterday at Mogaka Primary School in Kieni during the opening of a modern library built and stocked by donors. The lawmaker said he is ready to build computer laboratories in all schools in his constituency through the Constituency Development Fund if the government commits to equip them. The proposal comes at a time when the Auditor General has raised queries on how Sh16.3 billion out of  Sh17 billion set aside for the digital literacy programme was spent. Meanwhile, the MP has urged the proponents of constitutional review to share with Kenyans the questions they want to form the basis for a referendum.
