Oliver Musembi, Mathew Ndung’u and KNA @PeopledailyKe Ruiru MP Simon King’ara has said Parliament should enact a law to mobilise resources for cancer treatment. Speaking during a free medical camp in Ruiru on Saturday, King’ara said thousands of Kenyans continue to die because of the prohibitive cost of treating the disease. “Legislators should stop giving lip service and address the situation head on,” he said. He said health, being one of President Uhuru Kenyatta’s  Big Four agenda, should be given adequate resources. During the medical camp, more than 1,000 residents were treated for various ailments. Meanwhile, Meru Hospice founder Bactrian Kiringo has reiterated the need for preventive health care in managing the rising cases of cancer in Meru county. Speaking after completing a 7km Cancer Awareness and Fund-raising Walk, Kiringo said lifestyle change, including proper diet and exercise, are crucial in preventing cancer. “We should cultivate a tradition of having a balanced diet and avoid feeding our children with fast foods,” said Kiringo.
