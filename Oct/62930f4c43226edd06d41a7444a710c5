Washington, Tuesday US President Donald Trump has accepted the resignation of UN Ambassador Nikki Haley.He told reporters in the Oval Office that she would be leaving the post at the end of the year after doing “an incredible job”. He invited the former South Carolina governor to come back in a different role. “You can have your pick,” he said. This happened even as Haley denied claims that she was planning to vie against Trump in 2020. She told reporters that despite speculation, she would be campaigning for Trump, who has already announced his re-election bid. The president said Haley “has been very special to me, she has done an incredible job she is a fantastic person very importantly but she is also somebody that gets it”. He said of her role at the UN: “She got to know the players. She got to know China, India, everybody. “And they like her. And maybe more importantly, they respect her.” In April, Haley clashed with the White House when a Trump aide suggested she had prematurely announced a new round of sanctions against Russia. White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Mrs Haley had got “ahead of the curve” by previewing the policy, putting her remarks down to “momentary confusion”. She fired back hours later telling Fox News: “With all due respect, I don’t get confused.” The daughter of immigrants from India, Haley was a frequent and early critic of Trump during his election campaign whilst she served as the Republican governor of South Carolina. In December 2017, she said that the women who had accused Trump of sexual assault “should be heard”. At one point she suggested that Trump’s rhetoric could trigger a world war. And BBC New York correspondent Nick Bryant said she had formed a partnership with UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres to protect the UN against Trump’s anti-globalist agenda.
