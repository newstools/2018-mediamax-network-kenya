Zachary Ochuodho @zachuodho Occidental Insurance Company plans to open more branches and satellite offices in the country to boost its presence. Mike Eldon, Occidental Insurance, non-executive director, said the expansion, which aims to cover at least 24 counties in five years, is a response to the growing demand for general insurance products. He said confidence in the industry’s future has also influenced the decision to adopt a new corporate identity, adding the firm is on an ambitious growth path as part of the new strategy it launched in 2015. “In the last 30 years, we have expanded from one branch writing Sh11 million in premiums to Sh2.6 billion as at the end of last year. We see a lot of potential in the insurance sector as counties develop, and this is the driver of our expansion plans,” Eldon said.
