Philip Yego and David Macharia @PeopleDailyKe Leaders from South Rift and Central Kenya have declared their support for calls for a review of the Constitution. Led by former Bomet Governor Isaac Ruto and former Roads minister Franklin Bett, the politicians said there is need to change sections of the Constitution to “improve the lives” of Kenyans. “We want something that will add value to the lives of our people. We urge inclusivity in the process. We are going to come up with a caucus that will look at areas that we think can be changed to improve service delivery and reduce the burden on the people,” said Ruto, who is the Chama Cha Mashinani Party leader. In  Ndaragwa, MP Jeremiah Kioni  backed the campaigns for a referendum saying counties have lost the original idea of being drivers of development. “What we wanted counties to do has been lost not just in Nyandarua but across the country,” he said.
