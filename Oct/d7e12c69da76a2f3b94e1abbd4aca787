International tourist arrivals through Moi International Airport, Mombasa, has grown by 46 per cent  in the past eight months, the government has said.Tourism Principal Secretary Joe Okudo attributes the growth to, among other factors, the charter incentives programme that he said has raised the number of flights into the coast region. “Between January and August, Moi International Airport recorded arrivals of 84,286 visitors up from 57,588 recorded in the same period last year. This indicates a growth of 46 per cent,” he said. Okudo spoke in Mombasa on Saturday while receiving visitors from Tui Belgium Charter flight that brought in 150 tourists into Mombasa for a one-week tour of the Kenyan coast. The weekly flight is also expected to significantly increase the number of tourists from Belgium. The market last year recorded a 61 per cent growth with 10,170 visitors up from 6,320 arrivals in 2016. Belgium is ranked at number 10 in contribution of arrivals from the European market. Overall, the market share is at 0.9 per cent  of the total arrivals in both Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) and MIA. “We are keen on attracting more visitors from the market with ease of access through the connection to Kenya from Brussels via Netherlands (Schipol), Switzerland (Zurich) and Germany (via Frankfurt),” said the PS. Okudo said the success of the Charter Incentive Programme has greatly helped re-position the Kenyan coast as a tourism hub, adding that the support infrastructure such as roads, airports and airstrips within the region have complemented these milestones. He said the just-concluded SKAL Congress that brought together tourism professionals from 37 countries across the globe and the first to be held in Africa, has added to the positive profile the country has continued to build as a destination.
