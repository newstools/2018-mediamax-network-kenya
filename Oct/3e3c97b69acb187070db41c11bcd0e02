State counsel Sandra Kosgey said the prosecution told court they have to ensure the safety of the victim’s family and that of the accused  person, noting that it was not safe to release her on bond. “We pray that the accused be detained to allow police conclude their investigations,” she said. Appeared before Nakuru Principal Magistrate Joe Omido, Susan Njeri (pictured) was charged that on September 18 at Gichobo area in Njoro sub-county,deliberately breastfed the baby infecting it with the virus. The magistrate directed that the accused be detained at the Nakuru Police Station until October 17. “The accused will be detained until October 17 to allow the police conclude their investigations after which she will return for bond hearing,” ruled Omido. Njeri was arrested last week after she was found breastfeeding her neighbour’s baby. Residents said the baby’s mother had gone to work and left it in Njeri’s care.
