George Odiwuor @PeopleDailyKe Besieged Homa Bay County Assembly Speaker Elizabeth Ayoo has been barred from chairing sittings in the Assembly. In a motion tabled by Wang’ Chieng’ ward MCA Peter Kaula, the members resolved to pick any MCA to preside over sittings in the absence of the Speaker. The move comes in the wake of accusations that Ayoo is biased. Members have threatened to impeach her. The members accused the Speaker of being influenced by politicians eyeing elective seats in the next  polls. “We have not been able to achieve what the previous assembly did because of setbacks caused by the Speaker,” he said. Majority Leader Walter Muok said the changes are in line with the Constitution and Assembly standing orders.
