President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto today hit the trail in supervising the ongoing KCPE examinations as the government  moved to ensure a foolproof exercise. The president was at the Uhuru Gardens primary school in Nairobi while his deputy  presided over the commencement of the examination at the Musa Gitau primary school in Kiambu county. Meanwhile in Kilifi county, interior Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang’i who presided over a similar exercise dismissed claims that the government was militarising the exercise and instilling fear in candidates by deploying high ranking government officials to supervise the exercise.
