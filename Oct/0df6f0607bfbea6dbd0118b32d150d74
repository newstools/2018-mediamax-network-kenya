Kariobangi Sharks are at the threshold of making their maiden appearance in the CAF Confederation Cup. However, but the team’s tactician William Muluya has pointed out that they have to burn the midnight oil to make it happen at the expense of Sofapaka when the two teams side in SportPesa Shield Cup final on October 20 in Kasarani. Since their formation in 2000, Sharks have yet to attack Africa and Muluya have made it clear that his charges will be underdogs against a Sofapaka side that have previously carried Kenya’s banner in the Africa Champions League. “I think I cannot be faulted when I say that we are the underdogs. Sofapaka have a strong squad with a lot of experience and depth but given that football dynamics have changed, we are capable of handling them and hopefully win the coveted title,” said Muluya. However, Muluya reckons that Sharks, a team owned by Football Kenya Federation (FKF) President Nick Mwendwa, is capable of coping with the rigours of African football if it beats Sofapaka who are affectionately known as Batoto Ba Bungu by their fans. “Playing in Africa for the first time will really be a wonderful experience for the boys. It will not only be a big motivation for them but will also give them a chance to market themselves outside the country. They are all looking forward to the experience,” said Muluya. Despite Sharks appearing odds on favourites in the Shield final, Muluya said he has an all round good side that is capable of giving Sofapaka a run for their money. “For the better part of this season we had been grappling with injuries on an number of key players but I’m glad that the ones who I fielded adapted to my philosophy.
