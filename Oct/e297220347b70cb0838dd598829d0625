Senate Speaker Kenneth Lusaka, Kakamega Senator Cleophas  Malala and Ikolomani legislator Bernad Shinali have hailed the move by President Kenyatta to instruct the Ministry of Agriculture and the National Treasury to see to it that 2.6 billion shillings owed to farmers, is released. The leaders say the move by the President was in the right direction and a confirmation that he has farmers’ interests at heart. During his Mashujaa day speech the President indicated that sugar industry has taken more than twenty billion shillings of government funds with nothing to show.
