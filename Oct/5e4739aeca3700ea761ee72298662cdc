Bernard Gitau @benagitau Safaricom asserted its supremacy in the mobile services provision after transacting Sh34,880 per second through mobile money transfer, Communication Authority (CA) data indicates. The transaction translates to Sh1.1 trillion or a third of the country’s Sh3 trillion for 2018/19 financial year. The amount can fund the government’s Big Four agenda which was allocated Sh460 billion in 2018/19 budget. In this financial year, the government set aside Sh400 million for a cancer institute hence the mobile money transaction can facilitate the construction of 2,500 such centres. Safaricom leads on trends of mobile money transfer and mobile commerce services at Sh1.097 trillion, Airtel Money Sh2.569 billion, Equitel Sh328 billion, and T-Kash at Sh29 million. The sector regulator said mobile money service in the country has transformed from the traditional cash-in and cash-out transactions to a key driver of financial inclusion and facilitator for digital economy. “This has led to the emergence and evolution of services such as mobile loans, mobile savings, cross-border remittances and pay bills,” report said.In the last financial year, the number of active mobile money transfer subscriptions and agents stood at 29.6 million and 206,940 respectively. “Similarly, 727 million transactions valued at Sh1.9 trillion were made between April 1, and June 30,” part of the report reads. The value of goods and services transacted over mobile platform amounted to Sh1.4 trillion. A total of Sh675.5 billion was moved from person to person. The report also revealed Safaricom lost 1.6 per cent of its telecom subscribers’ market share, marking the third straight quarterly drop for the country’s biggest operator to stand at 29.7 million subscribers. While the users’ base was up 0.7 per cent from the previous quarter, Safaricom’s rivals, including Bharti Airtel’s Kenyan unit added more subscribers, resulting in the company’s reduced market share. Airtel’s subscribers rose 11.9 per cent to secure a market share of 21.4 per cent from previous subscribers of 8.7 million to 9.7 million. This means Safaricom subscribers’ market share has plunged to 65.4 per cent from 72.6 per cent in June last year. CA indicated that while, the revenue from voice still contributes the largest potion of the total revenue, research predicts that data and mobile money services are more promising revenue streams for the mobile services providers in the future. It probably explains heavy investments in the broadband infrastructure across the country and the quest for more financial inclusion. As at June 30, the number of mobile service subscriptions in the country stood at 45.5 million, translating to an increase of 13.2 per cent when compared to the 40.2 million subscriptions recorded as at June 30, 2017. This marked a 9.1 per cent increase in penetration in the financial year. High-speed fibre subscriptions doubled during the financial year 2017/18 to stand at 135,964 from 54,700 subscriptions posted the previous financial year, driven by high demand for high video definition streaming and increased competition among service providers. Satellite subscriptions have also increased significantly since the last fiscal year. The Authority attributes the increase to the Universal Service Fund (USF) School Broadband Connectivity project. The connectivity partially rides on satellite technology with over 800 public secondary schools connected in the 2017/18 financial year. The traditional mobile SMS service in Kenya has maintained an upward trend over the years despite increased us of over-the-top services such as WhatsApp. This growth is mainly attributed to the competitive retail SMS tariffs coupled with lucrative SMS bundles offered by the various mobile operators. During the fiscal year under review, total on-net and off net messages stood at 66.8 billion marking an increase of 17.8 percent from the previous financial year.
