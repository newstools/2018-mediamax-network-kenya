The High Court sitting in Nairobi issued orders dismissing an application by Stalwart Entertainment Limited that was seeking to stop Ngoma Festival Limited from using the name ‘Ngoma Festival’. The input of the ruling by Lady Justice Maureen Odero was that Ngoma Festival Limited was free to use the name as indeed the registrar of companies had lawfully registered it as a company. Also, Ngoma Festival Limited was allowed to hold their event dubbed Ngoma Festival: Ogopa Deejays vs Calif Records tomorrow without any interference. It’s set to take place at Uhuru Gardens and will feature performances by Wyre, Avril, Nonini, Sanaipei Tande, P-Unit, Kenzo, Big Pin, Jua Cali, Mejja, deejays Joe Mfalme, Hypnotic and Namoski. It will be hosted by MC Phillipo and Jalang’o.
