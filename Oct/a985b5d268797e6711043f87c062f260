Fifteen legislators from the Coast have said they will only back a candidate who has a clear agenda for the region in the next election. Saying previous administrations had sidelined them, the MPs said they will only support a leader who is serious about changing the region’s economic fortunes. “We will tell our people to support a candidate who has  the agenda of transforming the Coast,” said Kilifi North MP Owen Baya. The MPs, who were meeting at a Mombasa hotel, have already declared their support for Deputy President William Ruto. They also said the blue economy conference which will be held in Nairobi next month should have been hosted by the Coastal region. “We want to know how the region will benefit from the conference,” said Baya.
