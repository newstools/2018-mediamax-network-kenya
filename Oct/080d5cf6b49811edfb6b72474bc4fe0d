Murang’a Water and Sanitation Company (Muwasco) managing director Daniel Ng’ang’a was yesterday grilled by the County Assembly’s Water and Natural Resources Committee over the management of the company. He was taken to  task to explain why the company has not been repaying a Sh975 million loan which they took to facilitate water connection to the residents. Peter Gachuhi, a member of the committee said failure by the company to repay the loan will put an extra burden on the residents.“This loan has been accumulating interest which means that residents will have to pay more money in the end,”  he said. Ng’ang’a, while exonerating himself said the loan was taken by Tana Water Services Board in 2008 to facilitate the construction of a bulk water supply project which was completed in 2013. He, however, said  the company has not been servicing the loan because  they are unable  to collect enough revenue after  the county government slashed the water tariffs by almost 50 per cent. Members of the team chaired by Jane Wanjiru also accused Ng’ang’a  of irregular hiring of staff where several people working in the firm were alleged to have blood, proxy or  marriage ties.
