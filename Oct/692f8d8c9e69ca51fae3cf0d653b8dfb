Music lovers were in for a treat as singer Maia Von Lekow and the Big Sky took over Alliance Française in Nairobi during the weekly gig dubbed Showcase Wednesday. The event seeks to offer continuity to the ‘Spotlight on Kenyan Music’, by providing a small intimate setting for singers, musicians, music and poetry collaborations to get exposure and build audiences. During the show, Maia wowed her fans with an incredible performance of her songs from her previous and latest album titled Maia & the Big Sky, which is a fusion of Coastal rhythms, reggae, jazz, funk and folk. Performing songs such as Uko Wapi, Lola, Pawa and Jellyfish, her vocal and lyrical prowess was evident as she delivered lyrics touching on power, love, politics and strength of women. Over the years, Maia has built her music reputation, performing on varied stages across the world with artistes such as Keziah Jones, James Blunt, Habib Koite, Mafikizolo, Eric Wainaina and Kidum.
