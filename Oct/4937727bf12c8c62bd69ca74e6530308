WHO: WAZIIR KAKOOZA OCCUPATION: CLEARING FORWARDING AND EVENT MANAGEMENT CAR: 1980 TOYOTA CORONA MK2 Why did you go for this car? It’s a stable and comfortable machine. I’m not recommending one to try this, but if you’re doing anything up to 160kph and approach a corner, there is really no need to get on the brakes. The car is settled on the road. Further to that, I found that it is a unique car and there aren’t many on the road. In the whole of Uganda there are only two; mine and another one that is petrol-powered and has automatic transmission. In Kenya, I’m sure there’s none, so it’s as unique as that. What do you love about it? Because it is a refined and elegant car, many people appreciate it and want to use it on their big day, so it is a popular with couples that want a unique car for their wedding. I also like the fact that being a diesel-powered car, it is economical at the pump while still being powerful and torquey. To come for the Concours d’Elegance, I drove from Kampala and up to Nakuru, I used only Sh5,000 worth of fuel while my associates averaged Sh7,000 over the same distance. Are there any downsides? Nothing major to speak of, as with all classic cars, the body parts are a bit complicated to get anywhere, as I said it’s a rare car. This means if I have to replace something I have to import it and that is not as easy as with other cars. Oddly, engine parts are readily available, so I don’t have to worry about that. The only thing I have to make sure is that the car is well maintained and it never lets me down.
