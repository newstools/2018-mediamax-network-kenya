Bernard Gitau and Philip Yegon @PeopledailyKe Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga’s appointment as an African Union (AU) special envoy continues  to draw sharp reactions across the political divide. The question if Raila should quit local politics or not continues to dominate the debate. Some Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) politicians yesterday welcomed the AU post but maintained Raila would not quit local politics. Mathare MP Anthony Olouch said ODM is perturbed by the continued politicising of Raila’s AU appointment by some politicians. “Raila will discharge his new role both locally and internationally,” he said. Some Jubilee Party MPs  led by Ndindi Nyoro (Kiharu), Kimani Ichung’wa (Kikuyu), Didmus Barasa (Kimilili) and Oscar Sudi (Kapsaret) have urged Raila to retire and concentrate on his continental assignment.
