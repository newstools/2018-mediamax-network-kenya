DPPS The government is set to recruit 2,000 trainers to meet the high demand for tutors in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (Tvet) institutions across the country, Deputy President William Ruto has said. He said the first 1,000 tutors would be recruited in the current financial year and the second cohort in the 2019/20 fiscal year. Ruto, who spoke on Friday in Embu county during the first graduation ceremony of Jeremiah Nyaga Technical Institute, said reforms being carried out in the sector were focused on relevance, quality and access to training programmes to meet the needs of students after completion of their studies. He said the ongoing reforms in the country’s education system are aimed at improving the future of the youth by aligning education and training with the labour market. The DP said the country is yet to achieve its industrialisation goals because previous governments had not prioritised the development of technical education. “As a country, we have delayed on matters of industrialisation because we did not have the right vocational education system. We will now achieve the industrialisation needs of our country as we are  on the right track,” he said. He told the graduates that they hold key to the industrialisation of the country, adding that the government would upgrade the training institute to a national polytechnic status and urged the Tvet director to work with the institute’s management to ensure it meets the upgrade requirements. Governor Martin Wambora said area leaders would work closely with the National government to ensure successful implementation of development projects. Area Senator Njeru Ndwiga, MPs Eric Muchangi (Runyejes), Charles Njagagua (Mbeere North), Geoffrey King’ang’i (Mbeere South), Jane Wanjiku (Woman Rep), former MP Norman Nyagah, former Senator Lenny Kivuti and Tvet director Meshack Opwora, among others, attended the event.
