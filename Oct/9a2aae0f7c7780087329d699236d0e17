A sombre mood engulfed Navangala village in Kakamega county after it emerged that a young family of three was among the 56 passengers who perished in the grisly Wednesday early morning accident involving the Homeboyz bus. This comes just months after a boy from the same family drowned in a river while grazing  animals. Caleb Mukoshi, 27, his wife Lucy Kemunto, 26, and their son Zedekiah Ambani, 5, were to travelling for the funeral of an uncle, Jacob Shilosio, in Navangala when the accident happened. Mukoshi’s Mother, Florah  Luseno, told People Daily that her son had called a few hours before setting off from Nairobi to inform her he would be travelling with his family for the funeral. “My son called and told me he would board a night bus to Kakamega to arrive on Wednesday morning and join the rest of the family when his uncle’s body was to be removed from the Kakamega hospital mortuary,” she said. She received news of the accident from her son’s father-in-law John Osoro. “I am yet to get over losing another son in April last year then this,” she said. Caleb’s father, Joshua Luseno, who spoke to us by phone from Kericho, said the government through National Disaster Operation Centre has promised to transport all the identified bodies to Kakamega County Teaching and Referral Hospital mortuary through Kenya Red Cross. All the bills concerning the victims had been waived by the government, he added. Fredrick Lusuli, patron of Ikana Maendeleo Initiative, one of the NGO’s involved in supporting the victims urged traffic police officers to be vigilant and take stern action against speeding and unruly drivers.
