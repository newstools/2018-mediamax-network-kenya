Mercy Mwai @wanguimarci A group of MPs from Central Kenya have asked the government to immediately release goods estimated at Sh12 billion being detained at the port of Mombasa. The legislators also want the National Assembly’s Trade Committee to commence investigations into claims that the imported goods in 3,000 containers are substandard. They told the committee chaired by Kieni MP Kanini Kega to investigate why small businesspeople are being targeted after it emerged that hundreds of small importers had been stranded after Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) confiscated their goods. Led by Kiharu MP Ndindi Nyoro, the 12 MPs warned government agencies against auctioning any of the containers before a fair settlement is reached with the affected Kenyans. “It is the small businesspeople who are being targetted by rogue enforcers who have the mandate to define what counterfeit is,” he said during a press conference in Nairobi yesterday. Also at the press briefing were Gathoni Wamuchomba (Kiambu Woman Rep), Benjamin Mwangi (Embakasi Central), James Mwangi Gakuya (Embakasi North), Catherine Waruguru (Laikipia), Jude Njomo (Kiambu), Anthony Kiai (Mukurweini), George Kariuki (Ndia). Nyoro said it was regrettable that despite the many resolutions between the government and traders, the commodities are still being held at the port. He claimed that Chinese people had been given licences and taken over business for small traders at Gikomba Market, Nyamakima and Githurai areas. The legislators told the government to first define what counterfeit goods are and come up with standards that cut across before declaring goods as unfit.
