Barry Silah @obel_barry Leslie Sercombe atop Free Wheeler stormed to victory in the highlight Geoffrey Griffin Trophy at Ngong Racecourse with minimal effort. The 1,800m race that was timed at 1:53:07 at close was tactical and full of hard running in dry tracks. This was its 11th straight win in as many races for the mix breed fillie that has collectively had career earnings Sh919,658 for the Patsy Sercombe stable. Big running Western Ballad jockeyed by experienced Daniel Tanui only managed second; coming in four and a quarter lengths behind. The pace and power of Free Wheeler was too much notably from the final bend onto the straight as jockey Leslie Sercombe threw it into the middle line and pushed her to the limit. Western Ballad who has picked 10 wins in the same race category was tipped by many to cause an upset but had no firepower to chase the eventual victor. El Mundo jockeyed by Patrick Mungai preferred a gamble from the wide lane but could not cope with the speedy duo upfront thus settling for third in the well attended meeting. Meanwhile in the shorter 1,200m Kenyatta Cup, Charles Kimani produced a stunning run from start to finish jockeying X-Factor to sweet victory. Once again, the Sercombe stable brought out their best in a mission to lock out the competition. The commanding seven lengths gap between itself and highly rated As Paragon jockeyed by Martin Micino just proved a lot of emphasis on top speed was key in the race. The race that was clocked at 1:11:01 also saw Flash Harry on 13/2 odds and winner of the last edition relegated to third after a poor outing. The long distance 2,060m Delamere Handicap also saw an embarrassment of sorts witnessed after Paul Kiarie’s Winter Comet destroyed the pack. His 16 length gaps win over Henry Muya’s April’s Song was a record in itself in recent memory.
