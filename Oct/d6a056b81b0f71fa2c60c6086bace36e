David Macharia @PeopleDailyKe Chief Justice David Maraga has urged the public to embrace Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) mechanisms in resolving civil cases to save on time. He said bulk of cases pending in courts were civil, most of which can be solved through mediation adding that the Judiciary will train mediators to facilitate elders to preside over most of the cases. “Soon you will see magistrates and judges advising people to seek ADR in the first instant in court,” Maraga  said on Friday when he laid the  foundation stone for an ultra-modern Sh399 million court building in Ol Kalou town, Nyandarua county. The CJ said land dispute cases have roped in Kenyans living in the diaspora as many have been conned by their relatives after they sent money for buying and developing property for them. “We have so many pending succession cases that are recycled as parties insist on appeals and lawyers use a lot of English arguing in courts. We want to train mediators, who will help us resolve these disputes out of court,” he added. Law Society of Kenya Nyahururu Chapter official Chege Gakuhi urged the CJ to retain the Nyahururu High Court, saying that it serves a large jurisdiction that stretches to Samburu, Nakuru, Laikipia, Nyandarua and parts of Baringo counties.
