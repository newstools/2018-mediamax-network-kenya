Cairo, Wednesday @PeopleSports11 Sierra Leone’s African Cup of Nations qualifiers against Ghana this week have been scrapped owing to the nation’s unresolved row with FIFA, the Confederation of African Football said Wednesday. Sierra Leone was suspended by FIFA over government interference in football and was given a deadline of 1700 GMT on Tuesday by world football’s governing body to come up with guarantees that it had resolved the issue. “Qualifier matches Ghana vs Sierra Leone & Sierra Leone vs Ghana on the 11th and 14th of October respectively have been cancelled…” CAF said in a tweet. It added that the Sierra Leone Football Association had failed to supply the guarantees requested by FIFA to allow the suspension to be lifted. The West African nation was rocked last week when FIFA suspended it for government interference. The bustup is rooted in a move by the country’s anti-corruption commission to sack SLFA president Isha Johansen and general secretary Christopher Kamara during an ongoing probe into corruption and mismanagement. FIFA had demanded that the pair be reinstated when it announced the suspension on October 5. -AFP
