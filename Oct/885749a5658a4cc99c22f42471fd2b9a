Butali Warriors opened a three-point lead on the Kenya Hockey Union (KHU) men’s Premier League standings following a 4-1 victory over Sikh Nairobi at the weekend. The win saw Butali complete a double over their rivals to stay at the summit with 48 points, three ahead of the defending champions Kenya Police who beat Jaguars 1-0 in Kakamega. With third-placed Wazalendo and fourth-placed Green Sharks on 29 and 28 points respectively, the fight for the title is now a two-horse race between Police and Butali whose coach Godfrey Wakachunga expects more from especially with the return of some key players from injuries and suspension. “We have exactly what it takes to win the league. The win against Sikh is as important as any other and going forward, we are keen to have some of our players who are out due to injuries and suspensions return to help steer the team to glory,” said Wakachunga.  Sikh had also lost 3-2 to Wazalendo on Saturday to end the week pointless. Meanwhile, Wazalendo and Green Sharks also registered wins to maintain their third and fourth positions respectively. Elsewhere, Parkroad Badgers, who had shocked Butali by handing them a 1-0 loss the previous weekend were held to a barren draw by Nakuru to remain ninth with 18 points, a point and a place ahead of their opponents.
