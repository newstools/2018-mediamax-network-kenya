Mercy Mwai @wangumarci Parliament will commence investigations into the licensing of oil marketers following allegations of an increase of unlicensed  retailers. Consequently, the Energy committee chaired by David Gikaria will seek details from Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) on how licences are awarded. The action comes after National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi committed a petition by Pius Omollo and Agoi Vedell on behalf of oil marketers. “This petition therefore stands committed to the Departmental Committee on Energy for consideration. The committee is requested to consider the petition and report its findings to the House and petitioners in accordance with Standing Order 227(2),” said Muturi. “The petitioner prays that the National Assembly investigates the massive influx of illegal oil marketers in the country with a view to eliminating them or cause them to be licensed in order to operate lawfully.” In addition, petitioners claim that oil marketing firms had incurred massive losses as they had invested massively in infrastructure. Investigations come at a time when ERC has raised concerns over infiltration of cartels who mix kerosene with diesel. Speaking in Nakuru last week, ERC Director General Pavel Oimeke revealed the rogue traders were mixing the two products, with estimates indicating that 27 million litres of kerosene were ending up in vehicles. The petitioners claim that ERC licensing procedures lead to an influx of unlicensed agents storming the oil  industry where distort prices. “ERC has been licensing Oil marketing companies prior to engaging in the business of supplying fuel and it has emerged that unlicensed and illegal agents have stormed oil markets occasioning distortion of market prices and massive losses,” reads the petition. According to ERC, Kenya consumes about 33 million litres of kerosene per month which is much higher than the expected not more than five million litres of per month.
