George Odiwuor @PeopleDailyKe Cries for justice rent the air as the body of slain Rongo University student Sharon Otieno was taken to her home in Magare village, Homa Bay county. Mourners urged investigators to expedite their investigations into her death, which occurred  last month at Owade area in Rachuonyo South. Migori Governor Okoth Obado and his allies, county government clerk Caspel Obiero and Michael Oyamo, his personal assistant, are in remand having been charged with murdering her. Police, who accompanied the family to Med 25 Kirindo mortuary in Suba South had to intervene and contain the rowdy residents, who wanted to view the body.  Her mother Melida Auma fainted when the body arrived home for viewing. The family said Sharon would be buried in her paternal grandfather’s home this evening, where her unborn baby was also buried. According to Luo culture, Sharon should have been buried in her estranged husband Benard Owuor’s home. However, he had not paid dowry to make the marriage official and did not claim the body within 44 days. The family urged mourners to maintain peace during the burial.
