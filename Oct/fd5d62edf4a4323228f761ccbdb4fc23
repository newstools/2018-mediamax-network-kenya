Ushuru will attempt to overcome their 1-0 deficit to Nakumatt in the second play off match at Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani, Sunday afternoon. Pundits see the much anticipated duel that will settle the only remaining spot to next season’s Premier League, as the ultimate test of the taxmen’s mental ability. Since their relegation from the top-flight three seasons ago, Ushuru has come close to promotion but faltered at the last push. Ken Kenyatta’s charges that finished third in the just-ended National Super League (NSL) will need to beat the Shoppers by 2-0 if they hope to gain route back to the big time. By his own admission, he has his work cut out and will probably be making some changes in formation and personnel to counter the previous mistakes. “We were very unfortunate in the first match because we lost so many scoring chances. In the second half we dominated but sometimes football can be unpredictable. We still have this other shot, so until it is over, we are still in it. Just a couple of adjustments so that we can take the game to our opponents because it is possible,” said Kenyatta who could deploy speedy and creative players Barack Odhiambo and Baron Oketch in a bid to unlock the stubborn Nakumatt backline. Nakumatt under Melis Medo will have to get an early goal probably to settle their nerves. However, being a victory ahead, it should be an advantage plus an opportunity to play cautious and take chances when they come. The team that concluded the Sportpesa Premier League in a lowly 16th place will hope the first leg under firing trio of Cornelius Juma, Harun Nyakha and Timona Wanyonyi get their rhythm and purpose upfront in this crucial fixture. At the same time the midfield industry of Tom Adwar who scored the lone goal last time out and the defensive alertness of skipper Eugene Ambulwa can count for something if well gelled.             – BARRY SILAH
