Irene Githinji @gitshee The government has mapped out 25 low-cost boarding schools in Narok to accommodate candidates in the event that conflict escalates or recurs during the examination period. At the same time, the government will spend Sh4.2 billion for the administration of national examinations set to kick off at the end of this month. The ministry has also identified alternative centres in Nakuru, with some schools expected to join in and sit the exams together. Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed said yesterday they are in consultations with the Interior ministry to beef up security to ensure normalcy returns in the affected areas. However, she said there is relative calm in areas affected by conflict and schools have since reopened. “All pupils, including the candidates, have been accounted for. There were reported fresh cases of violence on October 8 in Narok North… we are however, actively monitoring the prevailing situation and will take the necessary measures to ensure examination materials are delivered to the schools as planned and that the security of learners is guaranteed,” said the CS. She made the remarks when she appeared before the National Assembly Committee on Education to respond  to questions on the state of exam preparedness. In Molo and Njoro sub-counties, 17 schools were affected by clashes.  In Narok South sub-county,  27 primary schools with an enrolment of 13,476 students including 1,087 candidates were affected. Additionally, six secondary schools with an enrolment of 1,183 students including 198 candidates were affected. As at yesterday, the CS said the rate of absenteeism had drastically reduced with only 110 students yet to resume but assured officers from the Ministry have since been dispatched to the area to facilitate full resumption.
