The government will before the end of the year commission the construction of two footbridges at Shaka-hola and Bombi along the River Galana in Kilifi county at a cost of 80 million shillings. The two foot bridges were swept away by floods in April this year cutting off links between Shakahola and Baricho while the other bridge located 15 kilometres away connects Bombi and Kisiki cha Mzungu area.
