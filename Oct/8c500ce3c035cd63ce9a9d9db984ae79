Mercy Mwai @wangumarci A parliamentary committee yesterday summoned top Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) officials to shed light on how  procurement queries during last year’s General Election that saw the country lose about  Sh9.5 billion. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said it has asked IEBC chairperson Wafula Chebukati and commissioners Boya Molu and Abdi Guliye to appear before them next Tuesday to respond to the said queries as raised by the Auditor General Edward Ouko in his latest report for the year ending June 2017. The three are expected to explain how the money allocated to the commission was spent, how it was lost and the individuals responsible. Addressing a news conference yesterday, PAC chairperson Opiyo Wandayi said  the committee had agreed to give priority to IEBC issues especially now that the country is gearing up towards a referendum. In addition, he also said the approach taken by the commission to fasttrack the IEBC issues is because they are matters of great interest to the country as elections are always very emotive. The move comes after Ouko revealed that the country lost Sh9.5 billion for various contracts awarded for the supply of goods and services during last year’s General Election and the repeat presidential poll. For instance, Ouko queried over Sh1.1 billion transport contract which the commission procured for county officers despite having no procurement officer at the said county offices. Ouko claimed  the commission bought excess data bundles for last years’ August poll. It bought 149,640.5GB valued at Sh127, 625,926 however only 605.3 GB valued at Sh515, 269 were utilised resulting in wastage valued at Sh127,109,656.
