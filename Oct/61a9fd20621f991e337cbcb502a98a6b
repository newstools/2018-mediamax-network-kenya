Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi A police officer attached to the integrated communication command control centre at Jogoo House, Nairobi, yesterday took the trial court through video evidence in the murder case of lawyer Willy Kimani and two others. The detailed video evidence showing the movement of the car used to abduct Kimani on June 23, 2016, alongside his client Josephat Mwenda and driver Joseph Muiruri as they left Mavoko Law Courts was captured by surveillance cameras. Kennedy Mwadime had been asked by his seniors to retrace the last movements of five vehicles including one that was used by the three in the last three days before they went missing. The footage he produced showed that on June 23, 2016 the vehicle was first captured at 5.53am on Forest road and then seen on Museum Hill heading towards Westlands area. The vehicle was also captured moving along  Waiyaki Way and later seen at Kinoo shopping centre at 5.36am. It was later captured  along Lang’ata Road, Bomas area, at about 6.28am and a few minutes later along Multimedia University heading towards Rongai. In a number of the images, two occupants believed to be Willy and Muiruri are captured. The vehicle was seen on the same morning along Mombasa Road heading towards Mlolongo. At 12.27pm, the time Kimani and the other two are believed to have left Mavoko Law Courts, the vehicle was seen coming from Mlolongo heading towards City Cabanas. The image shows a single occupant in the vehicle “The image shows a different occupant in the driver’s seat, he is a light-skinned person and that’s my general observation,” the witness said when asked to explain the discrepancy. Four Administration Police officers and a police informer (pictured) have since denied killing the three, whose bodies were later found at Ol Donyo Sabuk River stashed in bags.
