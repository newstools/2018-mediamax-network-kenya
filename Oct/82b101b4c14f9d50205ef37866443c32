Mercy Mwai @wangumarci The Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec) has invited examiners to apply online for  KCPE and KCSE marking. In a statement, the council said the online portal will be opened today for interested qualified  individuals to apply. Marking, Knec said, will commence immediately after the KCPE and KCSE exams are over. Those wishing to mark KCPE exam had between yesterday and October 31 to apply, while those seeking to mark KCSE exam can apply from October 15 to November 10. “The council invites the existing and qualified newly-trained examiners for the 2018 marking to apply online,” read the statement in part. Interested examiners can apply through www.knec.ac.ke. Last year, the government acquired 20 optical mark reading machines to improve efficiency in marking. The machines were also meant to reduce the amount of work by 50 per cent.
