The Office of the Ombudsman, also known as the Commission on Administrative Justice, is set to open its offices in various counties. Speaking in Kisumu yesterday, the commission’s chairperson Florence Kajuju (pictured)said they are partnering with counties to establish more offices to enable the public to access their services easily, adding that they have established full functioning offices in Kisumu and Mombasa counties. She said the commission’s mandate includes investigating any act or omission in public administration in any sphere of government. Kajuju said they have received more than 3,089 complaints from the public, which include abuse of power, unfair treatment and injustice, among others. Half of the cases have been solved. “The commission is working closely with the Judiciary to ensure we enforce administrative justice and promote constitutional values in public offices at all levels,” she said.
