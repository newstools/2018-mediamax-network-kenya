The 26-year-old Rongo University student who is at the centre of the prosecution of  Migori Governor Okoth Obado was Friday laid rest  more than a month after her badly mutilated body was discovered at Kodera forest in Homa Bay county. The late Sharon Otieno who was seven months pregnant at the time of her death was buried at her grandfather’s homestead in an emotional ceremony that was temporarily disrupted by  the deceased’s former colleagues at Rongo university.
