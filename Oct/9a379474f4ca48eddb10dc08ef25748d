The ghost of road accidents returned to haunt the country after 5 people were killed and several seriously  injured  after a Nairobi-bound Public Service Vehicle collided with two lorries at Duka Moja  area along the Mai Mahiu- Narok road. Reports indicate that the driver of the lorry lost control of the vehicle before ramming into the rear of a  Transline Classic shuttle that was heading to Nairobi which in turn collided with a lorry loaded with fish.
