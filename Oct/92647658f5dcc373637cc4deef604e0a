Mathew Ndung’u and Oliver Musembi. Kirinyaga Woman Rep Wangui Ngirichi wants men who sexually abuse young girls castrated. Ngorichi said that a law to enforce their punishment should be legislated forthwith to eradicate alarming abuse of girls. Speaking after addressing students at Kenyatta University during celebrations to mark the International Day of Girl Child themed “Empowering Girls Before, During And After Conflicts”, the lawmaker said  more girls have in the  past fallen victims to ‘killer’ sponsors. “There should be a law to enforce the punishment of married men who prey on young girls with an aim of using, dumping and consequently destroying their lives. They should be castrated to stop abusing our girls,” she said. Ngirichi told girls to instead concentrate on their studies and strive to become trailblazers to conquer the world.
