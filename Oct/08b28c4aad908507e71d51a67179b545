Eldoret Rally revs off Saturday morning at 8am from the Eldoret Town Hall in the centre of the Western Kenya Region. Clerk of the Course, Jagjeet Patter, is a happy man as the rains, which had hit the areas along the route a few days ago, have now subsided. “I hope to have a good rally with no rains, which had threatened the organisers in the last few days. The event is ready to roll with a majority of the title contenders in place and in the right mood to score vital points with just one more rally remaining in the current calendar,” said Patter. Eric Bengi and Tuta Mionki will make history as the second indigenous crew ever to start first in a round of the Kenya National Rally Championship since Patrick Njiru dominated the sport until late into the 1995 KNRC season. Their Menengai Oil-sponsored Subaru Impreza will be followed by the Mitsubishi Lancer Evo10 of Carl ‘Flash’ Tundo and Tim Jessop, who are seeking their fourth KNRC title. Uganda’s Hassan Alwi and Leroy Olinga are the only foreign competitors in the event driving in a Subaru Impreza. There are eight Subaru models, beating the Mitsubishi make by one in the competition. The penultimate round of the 2018 KNRC is set to run six competitive stages along the route of the 250-kilometre-long rally. The longest competitive stage will be 34km while the shortest stage will be 5.5km. Three stages will be repeated twice. The total competitive distance will be 142.60km (63.18 per cent) while Liaison Distance will be 83.10km (40.35%).Ceremonial finish will take place at Chemweno Farm, which is also the venue for the Service Park and Rally Headquarters. Scrutineering and reconnaissance will take place a day prior at Sikh Union Club.
