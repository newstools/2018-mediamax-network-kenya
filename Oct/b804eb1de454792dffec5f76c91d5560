Officials of Olaro Conservancy in Narok-West sub-county have called on the Narok Security team to resolve a land dispute between themselves and the community that is battling for resources within the conservancy. A section of land owners on the other hand staged protests denouncing the management of the conservancy, accusing them of having shot dead their cattle last week when herders invaded the conservancy in search of water for their livestock.
