Irene Githinji @gitshee The endemic corruption in many African countries requires generational shift to wrench it out of the system, US Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs Tibor Nagy Jr has said. Speaking yesterday in a telephonic press briefing,  Nagy said no amount of programmes can eradicate corruption in African countries, adding that there has to be a cultural change right from the leaders, bureaucrats, the civil society and every other individual in the continent. He said although the US government can assist with the situation, the drive to eradicate corruption must come from within individual countries to a point where it will be less of an issue as people become more empowered. “Eradicating corruption is my hope for the young people. They are so sick and tired of what the older generation has made them tolerate, that they will demand change,” said Nagy. “No amount of programmes can eradicate corruption. There has to be a culture change through education, empowering women in various societies among other initiatives. The US can help it along but at the end of the day it has to be a culture shift; must come from inside – from Africa’s youth,” he added.
