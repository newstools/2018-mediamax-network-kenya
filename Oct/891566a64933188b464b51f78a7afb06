Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Three former Kenya Power officials were yesterday arraigned over the missing report on faulty transformers and released on bail. The prosecution wanted former company secretary Beatrice Mogeni and ex-employees, John Mochere and Ruth Oyile detained for seven days for police conclude investigations. However, Nairobi senior principal magistrate Kenneth Cheruiyot ruled there were no compelling reasons to detain them and released them on a Sh1 million bond or a cash bail of Sh300,000 each. He, however, ordered them to present themselves before the investigating officer today and tomorrow in quest for the missing documents. “If in future there appears to be interference of witness or destruction or tampering with evidence, the prosecution is at liberty to apply for cancellation of bail and bond terms,” he said. The trio had been charged alongside former MD Ken Tarus, his predecessor Ben Chumo and 12 others with conspiracy to defraud the power company over Sh409 million. They reportedly purchased substandard transformers from Muwa Trading Company. The officials have also been accused of aiding fraudulent acquisition of Sh202 million as payment for the supply of the transformers.
