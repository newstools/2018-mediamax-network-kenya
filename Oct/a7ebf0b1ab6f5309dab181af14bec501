Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi The Employment and Labour Relations Court has suspended National Social Security Fund (NSSF) board meetings pending the reappointment and gazettement of Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli to the board. Justice Onesmus Makau suspended the meetings saying there is public interest on Atwoli representing his members in the board and there was no justification with the Attorney General Kihara Kariuki and Labour Cabinet secretary Ukur Yattani in delaying to gazette him. “To speed up the process of the board and the respondents complying with the gazzettment, it is only fair the meetings are halted pending determination of the suit,” he ruled. Atwoli had sued Yattani and Kariuki for failing to reappoint and gazette him as the Cotu nominee to the Board of Trustees of NSSF. In response, lawyer representing the AG and the Labour CS, yesterday argued that Cotu has two representatives on the board and Atwoli is fully represented.
