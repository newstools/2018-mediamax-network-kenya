Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe Siaya ODM chairperson Emily Awita has maintained that the next area governor will be decided by the party leader Raila Odinga. Awita urged local politicians to desist from engaging in early campaigns over the post and await direction from  Raila. “We want politicians to give Governor Cornel Rasanga space and time to work because engaging in politics will raise political temperatures and sabotage service delivery,” she said. Awita was reacting to comments made by Alego/Usonga MP Samwel Atandi,  MCAs Nick Ochola (North Gem) and Fredrick Opanga (North Ugenya), who vowed to back Ugunja MP Opiyo Wandayi for the governor race in the next election. Rarieda MP Otiende Amollo has, however, said the next governor will be decided after local leaders hold an expansive consultation forum. It could be difficult for Opiyo to clinch the governor’s seat given that area MPs including Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Chris Karan (Ugenya) and Amollo are reportedly  backing Senator James Orengo.
