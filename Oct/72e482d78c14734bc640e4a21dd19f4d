For those who are not familiar with Meryl Paige, she’s one of Kenya’s top R&B and soul musicians. She has worked with various local acts including Ythera and Linda just to name a few. Recently, during her concert that was held at the Best Western Plus in Nairobi, guests were treated to a sensational performance. She arrived on stage at around 9:30pm, a bit late than planned; however, the crowd was already turned up as they enjoyed the services of the hotel. Revellers went into a frenzy when she performed a rendition of Adele’s song Hello, which is one of her better known performances around town, to the adoration of her screaming fans. Though the event had a few hiccups and a noticeably low turn out, guests partied on until the wee hours of the morning.
