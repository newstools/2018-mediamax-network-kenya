The controversy that docked Ex-Nairobi Town John Gakuo in his sunset days in life seems to have followed him in his death  after the high court declined to discharge him from his 3 year conviction with his family vowing to clear his name. Sources close to the family have told K24, that the family is determined to ensure Gakuo rests in his grave a free man and not a convict. The court  has given them one week to present his death certificate, and communicate its decision on appeal the deceased had lodged challenging his conviction.
