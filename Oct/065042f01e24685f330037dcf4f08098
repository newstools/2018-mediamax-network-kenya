Nairobi, Thursday @PeopleSport11 Kenya’s head coach Innocent Simiyu says Uganda are under pressure to retain the Africa Cup men’s rugby sevens title, which will be contested this weekend in Monatsir, Tunisia. A total of 12 teams are in contention for the trophy. Champions Uganda will put their title on the line against strong opposition from hosts Tunisia as well as Kenya, Morocco, Botswana, Senegal, Ghana, Zimbabwe, Mauritius, Madagascar, Namibia and Zambia. Kenya held their final training session on Tuesday before departing for Tunisia on Wednesday, and Simiyu wants to walk away from the side when his contract expires on October 31 with a trophy in hand. Paul Murunga will replace Simiyu ahead of the World Series circuit, which starts in December in Dubai. In Tunisia, Kenya are set to play Morocco and Botswana in pool matches, as they seek to win a cup they most recently won in 2016 when they beat Zimbabwe in South Africa. “I know technically or physically we may be a bit better than most teams, but of course they have prepared, so we will leave no stone unturned and give our best,” Simiyu told reporters in Nairobi on Wednesday. The coach added, “There is more pressure on Uganda as the defending champions. For us we are just happy to be there, we just want to express ourselves, we have a lot of new blood coming in, we want to see how they will play, how they will respond to that level, and hopefully we can get a good result.”  Simiyu said that Herman Humwa and Michael Wanjala would captain Kenya in Tunisia.  – XINHUA
