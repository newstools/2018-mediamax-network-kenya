Emmanuel Masinde @baromeo Former world Youth 2,000m silver medallist Sandra Chebet says her focus is to feature in the World Cross-Country next year. The 20-year-old Chebet emerged the winner in senior women’s 8km category during the Safaricom-sponsored 10th edition held at Ndalat Gaa Girls’ High School, Nandi County. The Ndalat Gaa championship is an annual event celebrated in memory of its founder and former Athletics Kenya (AK) president Isaiah Kiplagat who succumbed to cancer in August, 2016. Sandra said that she wants to feature in the next year’s world cross-country , as she was timed 27.53.8 to win the title back to back in scorching sun and also improved on her time of 28.07.6 in the same course last year. “I would say my target is to get a chance in Team Kenya for the World cross-country championships and am going to train well so that I get the cut to the team,” said Chebet. In a very competitive race, Chebet beat Chemususu Dam half marathon champion Delvin Meringor in 28:05.0 to second before former Africa junior 2,000m champion Norah Jeruto who completed the podium in 28:16.2. Rhonex Kipruto , who won last year in junior category continued with his winning spirit and won senior men’s 10km race ahead of  Lagos marathon champion Abraham kiptum followed by Julius Tanki. Kipruto who missed to break the 10km world record with two seconds said he was off-season but decided to compete in the race, coming home with a win ahead of Tuskys Cross country meeting next month in Eldoret.
