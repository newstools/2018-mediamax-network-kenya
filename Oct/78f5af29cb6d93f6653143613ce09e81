There is no question Costa Montana, director at 254’s most flamboyant entertainment outfit in the region, A1 entertainment, is the epitome of style. From his flashy bling to clean cut look, the Greek and  Puerto Rican native has become one to watch in all matters style. He speaks to Eustace Maina I describe my style as…A1. Sometimes I dress simple, other  times I dress like I’m going to meet my biggest haters. I shop at…anywhere and everywhere. It comes down to where I find a piece. It could be in Europe or the US. I don’t have a stylist. I choose each  look myself. My favourite accessories are…watches, rings and chains. If I had all the money in the world…I would buy a bunch of islands. My favourite international designers are…Versace, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Burberry and Roberto Cavalli. Everyone should own…a watch because it is the most important accessory, especially for men. They also need a pair of good shoes. My best fashion buy is…my Saint Laurent white fur coat. It cost me a buck load. My signature scent…is One million and Black XS by Paco Rabanne and Versace Eros. My fashion obsession…is shoes, coats and jackets. I stock a lot on these because I enjoy matching say if it is the shoes with whatever top I have on. My tattoos are…a product of my environment. They are, especially inspired by my Puerto Rican heritage.  I relate more to it. I also have a tattoo in memory of my dad. He is no longer with us as well as a logo for A1 Entertainment. My heritage has…greatly influenced my style. As a Latino, you always want to look fresh from my hair (I went for a fade on the sides with a bun) to everything else. However, I believe it doesn’t matter where you come from. What matters is what you know about style and how to blend your looks.
