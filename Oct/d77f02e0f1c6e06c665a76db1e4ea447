Mukalo Kwayera @kwayeram President Uhuru Kenyatta will tomorrow evening hold a parley with leaders from Western Kenya at the Kakamega State Lodge,  People Daily has established. Coming just before Saturday’s Mashujaa Day celebrations that Uhuru will preside over at Bukhungu Stadium, Kakamega, the meeting will bring together all area elected leaders and  representatives of religious groups, trade unions, business community and professional bodies. The meeting will be the second Uhuru has held with area top political leadership in two weeks, however, State House spokesperson Kanze Dena could not divulge the agenda of the meeting. Kakamega Governor Wycliffe Oparanya , Senate Speaker Ken Lusaka and the Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi separately said they would attend. In their memorandum presented to Uhuru last week, the leaders, among other things, asked the State to honour former Vice President Michael Kijana Wamalwa, with the formation of a commission of inquiry on what has brought down sugarcane farming, which is the region’s economic mainstay. “Western region is coming together under unity of purpose…,” they said. Sources said the meeting seeks to enable Uhuru to get a clear understanding of the matters at stake and collectively arrive at solutions.
