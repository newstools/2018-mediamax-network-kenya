Elisha Kiprop and Josephine Metto walked away with Sh1.5 million each after braving the cold Sunday morning to take part in the 42km, 2018 Standard Chartered Nairobi Marathon, race and clinch gold. Kiprop cut the tape in 2:14.19 seconds, which was slightly slower than the winning time in last year’s edition, which was set at 2:12:39. En route to clinching his maiden Stanchart title, Kiprop had taken part in several races in the United States this year including Texas, Los Angeles and Houston marathons as well as defended his Grandma’s (Minnesota) marathon title for the fourth year running. “I have participated in Standard Chartered Marathon before, my best placing being a fifth place finish in 2011 but this year I resolved to come back and win. It has taken a lot of training to be able to run several marathons in a year and I am grateful for this title,” said the 32-year-old. He has set his sights on the 2019 Chevron Houston Marathon, having finished third this year to set his personal best (PB) at 2:09:32, where he intends to clinch gold. Julius Kiprono and Patrick Kibet finished in second and third positions at 2:15:01 and 2:15:09 respectively. On her part, Metto making her debut in full marathon, finished in 2:33.11 seconds, an equally slower time than last year’s 2:31:41 despite the conditions being better compared to last year’s edition, which was run under wet conditions. The road race and half-marathon specialist cleared the 6km mark in 21:03, 12km in 41:25 before pulling away at the 35km mark at 2:06:34 for the win. Metto was fresh from competing in the Chemususu Dam Half Marathon in September where she finished fourth. It was a rookies’ day in the women’s race as Cythia Jerop and Joy Kemuma, making their debut, took up second and third place at 2:34:12 and 2:34:53 respectively. Jerop was coming off a 10km win at Chemususu. She had also won the inaugural Kaptagat Forest half-marathon last month and finished third at Laikipia. Internationally, she has raced in Berlin, Twin City, Grandma’s, and Hannover half-marathons. “My racing internationally has not been good, I finished fifth at Twin City in 2013 and in April I finished sixth in Berlin which are my two best finishes. However, this result gives me morale to do better in upcoming races. I am targeting Tokyo marathon next year and hopefully I will do well,” said an elated Jerop. In the 21km race, Valary Aiyabei returned to defend the title she won last year, finishing in 1:12:06. Irene Jepchumba and Sylvia Kibet completed the podium finishes. In the men’s race, Mathew Kiprotich carried the day, cutting the tape in 1:04:57 ahead of Paul Kibet and James Kiplagat who posted 1:05:25 and 1:05:33 respectively.
