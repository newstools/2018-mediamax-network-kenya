For those who knew Bobbi Wine five years ago, meeting him now would drop a jawline. He is not the same person anymore, but he is still an artiste deep inside him. That is what the music bug does. A while ago, creatives met up at the Pawa 254 in a concert that added attention to the already growing buzz on Free Bobbi Wine. Apart from trending on social media and keeping the conversation going, nothing attracted the attendees more than a mural drawn at the PAWA 254 rooftop. However on Friday, it was a different story as the ghetto president himself spoke and performed for the hundreds of those in attendance. While at it, he was joined by Kenyan acts including Octopizzo, Tear Drops, Juliani, Red Accapela and Muthoni Drummer Queen. The later gave a small speech on why Bobbi Wine’s conviction for a better life for his people motivated her. And that is what many people saw while the Kyaddondo East legislator spoke. He paints a picture of the new frontier, artivism, and spoke briefly on why he strongly believes in his cause on People’s Power, Our Power. While in Nairobi, he walks around with a number of bodyguards and there is a new bromance in town, Babu Owino and Robert Kyagulanyi Ssentamu.
