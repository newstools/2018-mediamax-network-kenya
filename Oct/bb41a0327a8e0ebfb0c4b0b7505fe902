After more than  10 years  in the  political cold Migori Senator elect Ochillo Ayacko has bounced into the limelight. This is after the former Rongo Member of Parliament and one time Cabinet Minister won the Migori Senatorial by -election  defeating his main rival Eddy Oketch. Local observers say Tuesday’s  victory has given Ayacko a political lifeline to go for the much  coveted Gubernatorial seat in 2022  despite fierce rivalry on the ground.
