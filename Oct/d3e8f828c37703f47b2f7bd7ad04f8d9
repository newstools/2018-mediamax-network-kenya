National Environment Management Authority (Nema) has identified ocean pollution as a leading threat to government’s efforts to harness the blue economy and tap into the huge potential of marine resources. Director General, Geoffrey Wahungu said the country’s multi-billion-shilling sector, especially on fisheries and aquaculture has occasionally suffered as a result of sea pollution. “The main challenge of enjoying our blue economy is because of sea pollution by countries which still use plastics. The waste pollutes the ocean and affects the marine life. Most of the pollution is washed from other countries therefore affecting our blue economy,” he said. Blue economy is the optimum and sustainable use of maritime and marine resources for economic growth and social development. It incorporates the main aspects of fisheries and aquaculture, maritime transport, extractive industries, culture, tourism leisure and lifestyle, biotechnology and offshore energy. And ahead of the high-level sustainable blue economy conference to be hosted in Nairobi next month, the environmental agency said it will use the platform to showcase its contribution towards protecting sea pollution. Kenya’s inability to tap the multi-billion-shilling blue economy has meant the sector has been greatly underutilised with most recent research estimating the country lost at least Sh88 billion due to under exploitation of “Blue Economy,” especially the marine fishing. “Our neighbours, Uganda and Tanzania have not banned the use of plastics and this has been our challenge because they still find their way to the country through the common borders,” said Wahungu.
