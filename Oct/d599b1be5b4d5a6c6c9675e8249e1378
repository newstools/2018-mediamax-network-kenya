Barry Silah @obel_barry It was a déjà-vu moment as Ushuru booked a berth to the playoffs as the titanic National Super League (NSL) ended spectacularly. Indeed the 2018 season was one for the archives and the experienced taxmen were one of the big gainers in a day of mixed emotions across the division. Following their hard fought 1-1 draw with Bidco United Saturday at Machakos Stadium, Ken Kenyatta’s side have gone into the history books as the only team that have earned a Premiership play-off slot twice consecutively.  This year they face Nakumatt who finished the Sportpesa Premier League (SPL) season in lowly 16th place. “We have a week to prepare for perhaps the biggest contest of our lives. It is important that we forget the past and focus on the two forthcoming fixtures. I would like us to avoid mistakes this time round and my players understand this,” Kenyatta told People Sport in anticipation of the two play-off duels against the shoppers slated for October 21 – 28. While the gods of favour smiled to Ushuru who finished the campaign with 69 points, their other protagonists Nairobi Stima performed worse on the field of play and off it as well. Just after being humbled 4-1 by the rampaging Premiership returnees KCB at Camp Toyoyo, the powermen’s tactician Ibrahim Shikanda sensationally resigned. The usually shrewd Shikanda looked disillusioned after the final whistle at the touchline. “I feel my job here is done! Of course I am disappointed to have ended the season poorly but sometimes you cannot change much. I need another challenge; nevertheless I am very proud of my achievements over the past two years,” said the ex-AFC Leopards stalwart.
