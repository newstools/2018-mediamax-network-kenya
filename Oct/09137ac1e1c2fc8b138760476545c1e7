Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri was today admitted that the government illegally imported an extra 4 Million bags of maize over and above  the 6 million bags approved by an inter- ministerial committee. Kiunjuri who appeared at the senate ADHOC committee  probing the maize crisis could however not explain how the extra consignment was allowed into the country. The committee also expressed concern over delays in the destruction of a huge consignment of  contaminated maize that was declared as unfit for human consumption by the Kenya Bureau Of Standards.
