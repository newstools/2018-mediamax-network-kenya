Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Leaders in northern Kenya  have agreed to mobilise locals to complement government efforts in the fight against terrorism. Speaking after a closed-door meeting with Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i in Nairobi yesterday, the leaders, led by National Assembly Leader of Majority Aden Duale, said the move would go a long way in taming terror threat in the region. “We have agreed that all of us must read from the same script in the war against al-Shabaab terror group,” said Duale. Mandera Governor  Ali Roba said he regretted that the region has suffered economically and socially due to insecurity, but reiterated residents must be part of the solution if the area was to find lasting peace. “We have committed to work with the government to make sure our people become part and parcel of the solution,” he said. Matiang’i assured public servants in the region  of their security. “We are not going to surrender any part of our country to thugs. We are saddened by what happened in Arabia last week but we remain resolute. I want to assure all public servants who work in northern Kenya that they are safe,” said the CS in reference to an incident in which two teachers were killed in a raid by al-Shabaab insurgents at Arabia Boys Secondary School in Mandera. Education CS Amina Mohamed assured the leaders that the upcoming national exams would go on smoothly.  During the meeting, lack of synergy between the authorities and communities was cited as the key catalyst of insecurity in the region, with some locals harbouring criminal elements. Other leaders at the meeting included Interior Principal secretary Karanja Kibicho, Chief Administrative Secretary Partrick ole Ntutu, Garissa Senator Yusuf Haji and Elwak  legislator Adan Keynan.
