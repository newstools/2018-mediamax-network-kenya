Shock and grief engulfed residents of Kianderi village in Murang’a county after a man hacked his grandfather and another relative to death on Thursday night. The suspect, Kanyuko wa Wairimu, aged 26, reportedly walked into his grandfather Stephen Kanyuko’s house and hacked using a machete. He then turned on a relative Ephraim Mwangi, who was visiting, cutting him several times on the head. Mwangi, died as he was being taken to Kenyatta National Hospital, where he was referred to by doctors at Muriranjas Sub-county Hospital, where he had been rushed for treatment. The incident also left the suspect’s mother nursing injuries that she sustained while trying to rescue the two. Area residents described wa Wairimu as a bhang smoker, who had attempted to commit suicide twice. He was apprehended by police on Friday morning, despite going into hiding after the attack, and taken to Kahuro Police Station for interogation. The murder weapon was recovered. Kahuro Deputy county commissioner Wilberforce Kilonzo said Kahuti Police Post officers responded to distress calls in the village and started a search for the suspect, adding that the cause of the incident has not been established. “We want to get to the cause of the matter as the suspect stays in the same compound with his grandparents,” he said.
