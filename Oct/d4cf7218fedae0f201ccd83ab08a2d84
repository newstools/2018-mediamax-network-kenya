University of Eldoret’s Pippers have a busy weekend as they seek to move up the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) men’s league standings. The side will be in action in four fixtures where wins will see them move to the top-10. Saturday, Pippers have a date with Dedan Kimathi University, a side that is last on the standings after 12 matches without a win. In this encounter, the Eldoret-based students have an upper hand over their Nyeri-based counterparts. Pippers, however, head to their second fixture today as underdogs as they face unbeaten Ulinzi. The students are at disadvantage as they face the hard fighting soldiers just hours after their clash with Dedan Kimathi. “We expect tough matches but we will do our best in each fixture. We will be looking for a win in each match but against Ulinzi we hope to hold them since we know they are a strong side,” said team captain Harold Odhiambo. On Sunday, Pippers take on fellow Students University of Nairobi (UoN) in the day’s opener before closing the fixtures with a clash against Tigers. UoN are 19th on the standings, having managed just one win in 11 matches. Like Ulinzi, Tigers (formerly Ulinzi Youth) will be a hard nut to crack as they have played for an impressive eight wins, two loses and as many draws.
