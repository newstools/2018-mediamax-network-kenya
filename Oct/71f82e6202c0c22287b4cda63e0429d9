The Kenya Railways Corporation has released Sh7.8 billion to the National Land Commission (NLC) as compensation for land acquired by the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR). The money is meant to compensate 1,093 land owners in Phase Two of the project that will run from the Nairobi National Park to Ongata Rongai and from Ongata Rongai to Ngong Railway Station. Those to be compensated include owners of residential and business buildings pulled down to pave way for the project. Phase Two began in 2017 and is expected to cost Sh150 billion. It is scheduled to be  complete by June next year. Landowners in Ongata Rongai and Ngong had stopped the railway line construction demanding compensation after two lists of beneficiaries emerged, forcing NLC officers to take stringent measures to ensure only genuine landowners are compensated. When People Daily contacted  Acting NLC chairperson Abigail Mbagaya over the matter, she said the commission had put in place measures to ensure unscrupulous dealers and land cartels will not interfere with the compensation process. She said to avert a crisis, NLC had carried out land searches and intense investigations to identify genuine landowners. “The commission has carried due diligence on pieces of land to be compensated. We have already scrutinised landowners bank accounts as we expect the money to be released starting Monday,” said Mbagaya. “Schedule three from Ngong to Mai Mahiu and schedule four from Mai Mahiu to Narok will be compensated as soon as Kenya Railways receives the money from the government. The contractor shall resume work in schedule one and two immediately,’’ she added. The Kajiado North sub-county segment will host two railway stations at Kambi Moto and Embul Bul shopping centres. The 120km project is currently 77 per cent complete.
