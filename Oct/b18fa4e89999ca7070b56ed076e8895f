Garissa National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) coordinator Abdinoor Dubow has cautioned residents living along River Tana to  prepare for possible floods in the coming days. Speaking in Garissa town  Friday, Dubow said following an announcement by the meteorological department that several parts of the country including the North Eastern region would receive enhanced rainfall, it was prudent for residents  in the flood-prone areas to make early preparations. Thousands of residents, including irrigation farmers, from Garissa and Tana River counties suffered losses running into millions of shillings during the March-May floods. He said aid agencies, national and county governments encountered various challenged in mitigating the floods. “We should have a stakeholders’ meeting to enable us to interrogate coordination and information sharing on the disaster and see what were the lessons were learnt,” he said. Dubow urged the relevant authorities to prepare adequately for storage and transportation of the national examinations, which could be affected by the floods. He also asked the Health department to consider stocking drugs and vaccines to contain the possible outbreak of water-borne diseases, among other measures. Nyanza, Western, Central, Eastern, North Rift, North Eastern and Coastal regions and Nairobi and Machakos counties are expected to receive enhanced rainfall starting next week. Areas marked for flood alerts include Budalang’i, Kano plains, Tana River and Garissa counties.
