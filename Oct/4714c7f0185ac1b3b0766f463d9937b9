Napoli striker Arkadiusz Milik was robbed at gunpoint by two men on a motorbike as he drove home from Wednesday’s Champions League 1-0 group win against Liverpool. Milik featured for the first 68 minutes of the game but was substituted off prior to Lorenzo Insigne’s late winning goal. The Polish player was driving through the Varcaturo district at around 2am when a motorbike blocked the road. When he stopped, he had a gun pointed at his face and was told to hand over his valuables, the Naples-based newspaper Il Mattino reported. One of the men pointed a gun at Milik and made him hand over a Rolex Daytona watch, which is worth around Sh2.4 million (£18,000). The robbers then fled the scene on the motorbike, with Milik unharmed in the incident. Milik, who earns around £45,000 a week according to a report in Gazzetta dello Sport, contacted police, who have begun investigating the incident. Naples police could not immediately be reached for comment over the incident. Two years ago, Napoli forward Lorenzo Insigne, who scored the last-minute winner on Wednesday, and his wife were mugged in the city in similar circumstances. Media reports said the robbers told Insigne to ‘score a goal for us’ in his next match. Napoli’s captain Marek Hamsik was robbed in 2013, as was his wife two years before that.
