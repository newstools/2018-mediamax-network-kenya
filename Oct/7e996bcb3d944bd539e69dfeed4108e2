Barry Silah @obel_barry High Court Judge Msagha Mbogholi has called for the warring cricket parties to agree urgently so that frozen Cricket Kenya accounts can be unlocked. During a case mention yesterday, Justice Mbogholi was told that consent had been reached and that both protagonists were working on talks. In that regard, the judge advised that the process of reopening account be fast-tracked primarily so that the national men’s cricket team can be facilitated for the forthcoming ICC Division 3 World Cricket League qualifiers in Oman. The closure of the Cricket Kenya accounts after the matter was referred to the Sports Disputes Tribunal following battles between the government-backed Interim Management Committee (IMC) and a separate faction fronted by Tom Tikolo of Nairobi Provincial Cricket Association (NPCA). The pair had disagreements of the constitution validity, elections and officials running the sport. This move grossly affected operations of cricket in the country with players and employees at CK being left in limbo. This latest push by the court will certainly be godsend for lovers of the sport and particularly the technical bench. Speaking to People Sports, Tikolo (right) who is the NPCA chair said his side would review the court request and see the best way around it. “We will have to discuss and get the best solution so that the stalemate ends,” he said. At the end, Interim Committee member Edward Odumbe who attended the case mention expressed confidence that progress would be achieved.
