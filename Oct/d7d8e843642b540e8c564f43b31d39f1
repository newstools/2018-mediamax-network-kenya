One person is reported to have died and 15 others rescued alive after a building collapsed in malindi, friday morning. Rescue teams drawn from various institutions among them the Kenya Defence Forces, National Police Service, Kenya Red Cross and County Fire Brigade are at the scene as they comb through the debris in a bid to save those still trapped. The eight-storey building that collapsed on several nearby residential houses and a petrol station is said to have had tenants living in the lower floors, despite it being under construction. Police have had a rough time controlling the crowd that had gathered at the scene to witness the operation, and had to spray water on them using the fire engines to disperse them, while survivors were rushed to Malindi Sub County Hospital for treatment.
