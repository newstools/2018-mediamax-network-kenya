George Kebaso @Morarak Governors have asked the national government to withdraw with immediate effect a caveat limiting county staff from foreign trips. Coming just two days after the national government released new guidelines, on Friday, the Council of Governors (CoG) expressed displeasure with the move saying it hoped the matter would be solved amicably without attracting unnecessary friction. “The council therefore asks you to withdraw the above letter with immediate effect. It is our hope that this matter will be settled amicably without resulting in an unnecessary public exchange or even legal recourse,” said CoG chairman, Josphat Nanok. Nanok’s sentiments are contained in a letter he wrote to Devolution Principal Secretary Charles Sunkuli and copied to  Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa, and Head of Public Service, Joseph Kinyua. On Tuesday, the national government said the guidelines were part of austerity measures informed by by the need to rationalise travel budgets across board.
