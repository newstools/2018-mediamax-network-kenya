Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe The Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa) has launched a probe into 16 cases of fatal shootings linked to police officers in the past two weeks. The authority said it has taken the initiative as provided for in their mandate under law. “On its own motion, and acting pursuant to its statutory mandate under Section 25(1) of the Ipoa Act that requires the authority to investigate deaths and serious injuries caused by police action, Ipoa has launched independent investigations into the incidents with a view to unravelling the circumstances that led to the fatal shootings, and particularly whether the police officers were justified in the use of firearms,” Ipoa’s director of communication Dennis Oketch said. Part of the probe involves shooting of six rape and robbery suspects in Dandora.  However, fresh details indicate only two of the six persons were robbers. Contrary to police information, two brothers said to have been visiting their uncle were sleeping when the robbers sought refuge to evade police arrest. Three other suspected robbers were shot and killed by police in separate incidents in Huruma and Mathare areas on Monday. In Migori, an Administration Police officer attached to Kegonga AP line allegedly fatally shot a man in unclear circumstances while three others were killed in Kerugoya last Sunday. And in Yatta, three suspects were shot dead and two others seriously injured a week ago. “The various matters are under investigations. Upon conclusion, if police are found culpable, the officers responsible will face the law,” said Oketch.
