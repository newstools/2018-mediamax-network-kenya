Barry Silah @obel_barry Importers and small traders plan to close their businesses today, citing State harassment and detention of over 3,000 of their containers at various ports of entry. Nairobi Importers and Small Traders Association (NISTA) organising secretary Anne Nyokabi said the traders will take to the streets to avert the imminent auction of their goods estimated to be worth Sh12 billion. Over the past eight months, businesses under the umbrella body have faced serious challenges that have seen most either close shop or face auction due to unpaid loans. According to the association, an estimated 10,000 businesses and 50,000 indirect jobs have been affected  and blamed the government for paying lip service to their woes. Nyokabi who spoke during a press conference in Nairobi called on the membership to turn out for a mass action to air their grievances for an indefinite period,  adding that all businesses will close shop and hit the streets in all major roads during the period. “We have incurred heavy losses and we feel like government has abandoned us. The association has tried all avenues to meet and talk to relevant agencies but nothing doing,” she said. “It is indeed shocking that the government keeps referring to our products as counterfeit yet they have no clear definition of the term. We believe there is collusion with multinationals to kill the livelihood of small traders who contribute to this economy,” Nyokabi added.
