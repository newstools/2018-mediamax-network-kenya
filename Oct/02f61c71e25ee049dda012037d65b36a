A recent notice by the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) opposing a proposal to have grades for students enrolling to the Teachers Training Colleges lowered, has sparked sharp criticism fromÂ a section of KNUT officials. The Kenya National Union of Teachers West Pokot branch has castigated the Teachers Service Commission and Kenya Union of Post Primary Teachers(KUPPET), for opposing the proposal saying they are misleading Kenyans yet more teachers are needed especially in marginalized areas.
