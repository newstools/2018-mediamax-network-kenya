After giving his life to Jesus last year, Kenyan rapper, Cannibal, is dismissing all the doubters and naysayers who think his salvation will not stand the test of time. Famed for hits such as Kichwa Kibovu, My City My Town, Street Hustler and Legend, the rapper is proving the ‘haters’ wrong by insisting he is no longer interested in ‘worldly’ things anymore. “Right now, my focus is to maintain my relationship with God and let all those who are making noise be. My testimony will stand for itself and again, I am focused on making more great music,” he told PD Wikendi. According to him, he is still facing newer challenges everyday, but remains adamant that he will manage his new lifestyle as a Christian, away from drunkenness and other drugs. This week, under Genius Records, Cannibal released a collaboration song titled Kwanii Remix, with Weezdom, DJ Sadic, Kris Erroh, Holy Dave and Stonee Jiwe.
