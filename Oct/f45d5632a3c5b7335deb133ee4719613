Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu War against illicit cargo has gone a notch higher following a recent move by Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) to establish a National Integrated Scanning Solution which enables custom officials in main command centres in Nairobi and Mombasa to get transmissions of all scanner images on real time. KRA southern region deputy commissioner Nicholas Kinoti said the technology will minimise chances of misdeclared cargo passing the scanners unnoticed since several custom officials will be in a position to get images of the scanned cargo in unison. He said the available 12 scanners countrywide, including six at the southern region that are situated at the port of Mombasa, Moi International Airport and one in the console base Container Freight Stations, have been integrated to support the verification process. “This is a non-intrusive verification tool. We are able to verify the cargo through scanning without necessarily having to open the container,” said Kinoti. In addition, the deputy commissioner said the authority is in the process of acquiring two ultramodern drive through scanners which can scan 1,200 containers a day, thereby modernising the clearance systems. Speaking at the regional command centre in Mombasa, the coordinator said the technology enables real time analysis of the transmitted images, which then informs the next course of action. “After the analysis, we are able to decide whether to open the consignments or release them immediately,” he said. He said the deployment of the technology is a game changer towards customs related clearance risks. Cargo that is complaint with customs regulatory requirements is released on real-time while consignments that are found not to have complied are taken to a secluded G-section for in-depth verification.
