A consortium of more than 90 multi-national companies from China operating in Kenya have reiterated their plans to provide quality employment opportunities for local youth as part of their business development strategies. The companies, under the Kenya China Economic Trade Association (KCETA), and the Chinese Embassy in Kenya have committed to continue rolling out sustainable human resources development programmes geared at promoting career growth for the youth. Consequently, the companies will host a one-day career fair at the Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC) on Monday, to raise awareness on career and job opportunities for local youth in their firms. Participating firms include Huawei Technologies, China Road and Bridge Corporation, Sinohydro Corporation and AVIC International. KCETA secretary Emily Li Chen said: “As a crucial player in the country, it is our mission to build good businesses in Kenya to boost the economy. One way to achieve this is through availing opportunities, especially to the youth who have just cleared their university or college studies, and those who have some experience in the various industries, to provide them with career growth opportunities, enabling them to apply the skills learnt in school.” Cabinet secretaries Amina Mohamed (Education), Monica Juma (Foreign Affairs), Ukur Yattani, (Labour) and other Chinese Companies’ chief executives and HR directors are expected to attend the event.
