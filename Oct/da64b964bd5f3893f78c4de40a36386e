George Odiwuor @PeopleDailyKe Two Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exam candidates from Homa Bay will today write their tests from the hospital bed. Donald Otieno of Oluso Primary School was hospitalised after a snake bite while  Felix Ochieng was admitted to the Homa Bay Referral Hospital yesterday with joint pains. Otieno’s mother Judith Naynago said her son was bitten in the right hand while hunting birds. “He hit a bird and it fell in a bush. When he extended his hand to pick it, a snake pounced on him,”she said, adding that he was taken to Rangwe Sub-county hospital and later transferred to Homa Bay Referral Hospital. County Education director Margaret Mwandale said the candidate would be assisted to write his English composition and Kiswahili insha papers. “The candidate has difficulties using his right hand. An official from the Ministry of Education will assist him write the exams. He will narrate his stories which will be transferred to the paper,” she said. The education official inspected the hospital rooms where Otieno and Ochieng will sit their exam. She, however, said Otieno would not be assisted in other papers like Science, Mathematics, English grammar and Kiswahili lugha. “The other papers require  shading on answer sheet which the candidate can do with his left hand,” said Mwandale. Lydia Olekete, a nurse at the hospital, said the candidate’s finger may be amputated if the condition worsens. Mwandale said security personnel and the Kenya National Examinations Council officials have been informed of the two cases. “A police officer will escort the papers from the respective schools to the hospital and take them back after the candidates are through,” she said.
