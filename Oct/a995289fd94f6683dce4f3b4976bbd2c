Former SportPesa Premier League (SPL) side Ushuru will be seeking a return to the top -flight football when they face Nakumatt in a promotion/relegation play-off first leg match expected to provide fireworks at Camp Toyoyo tomorrow. According to Football Kenya Federation (FKF) secretariat, the return leg will be played on October 28 at the Moi International Sports Centre, Kasarani. The two sides are fighting for a chance to feature in the seven-month long 2019 SPL season that kicks off on December 8. Already National Super League (NSL) champions Western Stima and second-placed KCB have secured their spot. Nakumatt who have enjoyed three seasons at the top league, currently find themselves in this position after finishing 16th, one point behind Posta Rangers while Ushuru missed direct ticket as they finished third in the second-tier league on 68 points and going by the new promotion format introduced by the federation in their new constitution, the third last SPL team and third NSL side have to battle it out for the last available slot. Nakumatt, who were promoted to the premier league at the end of the 2016 season when the league was expanded to 18 teams, up from 16, needed a win against Vihiga in their final league match to avoid the dreaded 16th position but lost 2-0. Nakumattâ€™s first season at the top tier saw them win 10 matches, draw nine and lose 15 to finish 15th, surviving the playoffs by one point.
