Former Sports CS, now Kenya’s Ambassador to Austria, Hassan Wario, has been charged with six counts of abuse of office, and released on a 1 million shillings bail with a personal bond of a similar amount, over the Rio 2016 Olympics scam. The former CS appeared before chief magistrate Douglas Ogoti of the Anti-Corruption Court in Milimani today. Wario and athletics legend Kipchoge Keino were on Thursday questioned after they turned themselves in to police, following recommendations by the Director of Public Prosecutions, Noordin Haji. In a twist of events, Keino turned into a state witness in the sh55 million scandal after police discovered he did not sign any documents. He was questioned for more than six hours.
