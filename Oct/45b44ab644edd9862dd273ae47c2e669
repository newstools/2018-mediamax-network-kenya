Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi has called for investigations into the operations of  the National Land Commission (NLC). He accused the commission of failing to resolve chronic land problems in the coastal area since independence. Speaking during Mashujaa Day celebrations at Karisa Maitha Stadium in Kilifi town, Kingi said six years after the formation of NLC residents have nothing to show as many were still landless. “Recently, the commission, led by the acting chairperson Abigail Bagaya, was in the county and held a public hearing of Chembe-Kibabamuche and Kijipwa settlement scheme but up to now nothing has been resolved,” he said. “Every year,  during Mashujaa Day celebrations Coast leaders keep on blaming NLC for failing to resolve the land problems and we are now tired. The commission needs to be investigated,” he added. Kilifi Commissioner Magu Mutindika said  most insecurity cases in the region were as a result of land disputes such as grabbing by private developers and the elderly being  killed by family members so as to sell  land and buy boda bodas and start such businesses.
