Yusuf Masibo , Winstone  Chiseremi The Kenya National Union of  Teachers (Knut) has warned that schools may fail to open early next year if the Teachers Service Commission (TSC) fails to address issues affecting its members. Knut secretary general Wilson Sossion said teachers  resolved to call off a strike this term as it was going to interfere with the ongoing exams. Speaking at Kanduyi stadium during the Bungoma South teachers Annual General Meeting, Sossion (pictured) said teachers were also parents and their children are also affected during strikes. “We are also parents and if we could have called for a strike this term, we could have interfered with exams ruining the lives of our sons and daughters,’’ he said. Sossion said parents should be prepared to keep their children at home longer in January 2019 saying they will announce the strike at the beginning of the year. “This time round, its not going to be business as usual. So parents should not think that their children will be at home for only two months. It is going to be more if TSC does not hold talks with us before then,” said Sossion. He said among the issues they want TSC to address is delocalisation of teachers, promotions and employment of teachers.
