George Kebaso @Morarak Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko and Water Cabinet Secretary Simon Chelugui have told Murang’a Governor Mwangi Wa Iria to stop politicising water provision services. While Sonko said Murang’a is just a host of Ndakaini Dam and not the water source, the CS called for a sober dialogue, saying provision of essential services to Kenyans does not require unnecessary confrontations. Speaking at Maji House yesterday, Sonko said water has no boundaries because it flows through many counties and he has never heard the other governors complaining. “Wa Iria is my friend but should stop politicising water issues. As he continues to threaten to block water from flowing to Nairobi, he will be denying the president and Murang’a people, who live in the city, their right,” he said. “Article 62 of the Constitution says all rivers and other water bodies are public utilities. And it is supported by Article 4 which gives everyone the right to water,” he added. Wa Iria had threatened to disconnect the water pipeline to Nairobi, saying his county does not benefit from the water it gives the capital city. Sonko reiterated that Nairobi fully procured the dam and has its original title deed.“We have complied with the law. We have genuine papers showing we own the dam through Nairobi Water and Sewerage Company,” he said. Chelugui, however, said he prefers dialogue so that amicable solutions can be found on how people and animals can access the water. “Water is life. There are counties that have more water than others, but they don’t bar them from accessing this natural utility,” he said before flagging off two Nairobi City Regeneration vehicles that are mounted with sewer flushing units. The Sh54 million equipment funded by the World Bank through Athi Water Services Board (AWSB) is meant for water and sanitation services improvement in the city.
