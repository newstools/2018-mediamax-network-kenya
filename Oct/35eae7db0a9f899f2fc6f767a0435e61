After Eldoret Youth sealed their promotion to National Super League as well as FKF Division One Zone B League title last weekend with Shabana securing a playoff slot in second position and Nyakach United and Griffins relegated, the league continues this weekend in its penultimate round with focus now turned to golden boot battle. The centre of attention will be on who will be the league’s top scorer at the end of the season in the remaining two matches in a tightly contested race where Transfoc’s prodigy Collins Juma leads the chart with 14 goals while Alex Nzei Ingambia of Raiply is breathing on his neck with 13 goals in second place. Ingambia alongside his teammates Emmanuel Makwingwi and Victor Lisamula who have scored nine goals each, will lead Raiply onslaught when they visit Shabana FC who will be banking goal scoring services on highflying Oscar Oketch (nine goals) and Bob Mugalia (six goals) in a match slated at Mosocho Academy today while Juma will lead his Transfoc side when they welcome St. Joseph’s Youth Academy at St. Anthony’s Boys School. Kevin Cheti with nine goals to his name, will be hoping to get more goals when he leads his already promoted Eldoret Youth side against Transmara Sugar at Wareng’ High School while third best goal scorer so far Micah Kipyegon with 11 goals, will be eyeing to score as many goals as possible when he leads his team Silibwet FC in an away match to Bondo United at Migwena Grounds in Bondo.
