Kinyuru Munuhe @kinyurumunuhe Government Spokesman Eric Kiraithe said a strike threat by the Kenya Aviation Workers Union will not disrupt launch of direct flights from Nairobi to New York. He, however, urged KQ workers to be more reasonable in their demands. KQ staff on Monday threatened to frustrate the much publicised maiden direct flight to the United States citing breakdown in talks over special pay and working conditions with the national carrier. They also demand full implementation of their Collective Bargaining Agreement. Transport Cabinet secretary James Macharia and Kenya Airways chief executive officer Sebastian Mikosz said the boycott is a threat to its new bid to generate and increase the airline’s revenue but assured the plans will go on as scheduled. The plane is set to leave the Jomo Kenyatta International Airport (JKIA) at 11.25pm on Monday and land at John F Kennedy International Airport in New York at 6.25am on Tuesday. It will then leave New York at 12.25pm the same day and land in Nairobi at 10.55am the following day. The flight formed part of the discussion by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his US counterpart Donald Trump when the two met at the White House in August. They also resolved to enhance trade and investments between the two countries and the continent. The daily direct flights by KQ are expected to spur growth in business and the tourism sectors.
