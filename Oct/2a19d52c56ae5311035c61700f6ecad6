Senate has assured Members of County Assemblies (MCAs) of progress in the creation of the ward development fund. Senate Leader of Minority James Orengo said the County Wards Development Equalisation Bill, 2018, which seeks to establish the kitty will be discussed in the next House sitting. He said  the Senate is likely to ratify the bill  in the spirit of pushing for the realisation of the fruits of devolution. Orengo said if enacted, the proposed legislation will ensure equitable development and distribution of resources in the counties. “Senators are committed to ensuring resources are fully decentralised and this is a gesture that establishment of the ward fund may not be rejected,” he said while addressing Kisumu County Assembly. The bill, which was sponsored by Murang’a Senator Irungu Kang’ata, seeks to establish a Sh21.8 billion development kitty for all wards, among others.
