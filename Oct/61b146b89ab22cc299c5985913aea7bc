Reuben Mwambingu @reubenmwambingu The National Police Service (NPS) has asked the public to embrace the recent police reforms, including integration with junior police officers. NPS director Masoud Mwinyi said the reforms were meant to  enhance national security,  clean up the bad image that is associated with the police service. Some Kenyans had expressed concern over integration with the officers, saying some might use their guns to intimidate and harass the public. Speaking in Mombasa, Mwinyi allayed such fears, saying the police would not be staying with their guns at home and therefore mwananchi need not to be afraid. He added that officers would be collecting their guns from the armoury at their respective work stations before returning them after work. The move will be directly beneficial to mwananchi on security matters,” he said, adding that it will be difficult for criminal gangs to live in an area inhabited by police. “One of the wisest decisions the government has done under these reforms is to allow police to live with the public because this will further enhance the relationship between them,” he said. Following last month’s announcement by President Uhuru Kenyatta on police reforms, junior police officers are set to vacate police line houses and start receiving house allowances. The changes were to be effected within 90 days.
