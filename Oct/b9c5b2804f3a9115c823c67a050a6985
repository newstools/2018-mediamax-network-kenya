Kenyans are still waiting for the state-of-the-art new stadiums promised by the Jubilee government when they assumed power in 2013. Worse still, renovations of Nyayo, Kinoru and Kipchoge Keino stadiums have stalled as contractors demand for payment. But while Kenya drags its feet, some around the world are not joking. 1. Stadio della Roma, AS Roma Capacity: 52,500, expandable to 60,000 Due date: 2020-2021 season Costs: Sh35.6 billion Roma president Jim Pallotta is determined to give the Italian club its own home after 65 years of sharing the Stadio Olimpico with fierce rivals Lazio. The project to build the Stadio della Roma was finally given panning permission in December last year but hit a snag when the mayor of the proposed site, Virgina Raggi, rejected the proposal. A compromise has since been reached, and the new stadium will be built on an old race track at Tor Di Valle, in the south west of the City. 2. Espai Barca project, Barcelona Capacity: Increase from 99,354 to 105,000 Due date: 2020-2021 season Cost: Sh42 billion The Espai Barca project plans to renovate the Nou Camp and drag it into the 21st Century. The plans involve increasing the stadium’s capacity, as well as adding a roof, underground parking and improving Wi-Fi access. The first tier of the ground will also be remodelled to be more vertical, for a better viewing experience. The project, unveiled by President Josep Maria Bartomeu back in March 2016, goes beyond just the stadium, with improvements planned for the entire Barcelona campus, including a 12,000-seater arena for other Barca sports teams such as basketball. 3. New Sardar Patel Stadium, Gujarat, India Capacity: 110,000 Due Date: 2020 Cost: Sh9.7 billion The New Sardar Patel Stadium in Gujarat, India, will become the world’s largest cricket ground when it is completed in 2020. The stadium’s capacity is anticipated to be a whopping 110,000, which is 10,000 more than the Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG), the current largest stadium for cricket. The stadium will cover 63 acres of land and will boast an Olympic-sized swimming pool, 76 corporate boxes and enough space for 3,000 cars and 10,000 bicycles. The project is backed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, and construction is already underway, with the Gujarat cricket team and Rajasthan Royals aiming to move in by 2020. 4. New Puskas Ferenc Stadium, Budapest, Hungary Capacity: 67,889 Due Date: 2019 Cost: Sh67 billion The new home to Hungarian football will open its doors in 2019 and will replace its namesake in Zuglo, Budapest, which was demolished in October 2016. Hungary are not the footballing powerhouse they once were but they will be showcasing elite football here in the very near future, as the ground has been chosen to host three group stage matches and a round of 16 match during UEFA Euro 2020. 5. New National Stadium, Tokyo, Japan Capacity: 68,089 Due Date: 2020 Cost: Sh110billion Japan’s new national stadium was originally designed by well-known architect Zaha Hadid but a public outcry at spiralling costs led to a rethink at the instruction of prime minister Shinzo Abe. The new design, by Kengo Kuma, has a natural feel, made up of a wooden frame and surrounded by foliage. It was originally hoped that the new arena would be ready for the 2019 Rugby World Cup but it is now expected to be ready for the 2020 Summer Olympic Games. 6. LA Stadium, California, USA Capacity: 70,240 Due Date: 2020 Cost: Sh592 billion This is one expensive new home. The Los Angeles Stadium will play host to the LA Rams and the LA Chargers from 2020. The project is spearheaded by Rams owner and familiar face Stan Kroenke, now the majority shareholder at Arsenal, and it includes retail space, a hotel, a park and some new homes on a 300-acre plot. The stadium will host the Super Bowl in 2022 and is expected to host the Olympics in 2028. 7. Nou Mestalla, Valencia, Spain Capacity: 54,000 Due Date: 2021 Cost: Sh36 billion The Nou Mestalla has been in construction for well over 12 years. The ground fell victim to Valencia’s financial difficulties, exacerbated by the total collapse of Spain’s property market in 2008. But after years of waiting, it’s now or never for the Nou Mestalla, because if construction doesn’t restart soon, the existing structure will have to be demolished. But the omens are good; in October 2017 Valencia were given permission to restart construction, while earlier this year the club agreed a partnership with Deloitte to help finance the building process. 8. Lusail Iconic Stadium, Lusail, Qatar Capacity: 80,000 Date Due: 2022 Cost: Sh4.5 trillion The Lusail Iconic Stadium is the showpiece venue for the 2022 World Cup and is set to be used for the opening and final games of the tournament. Its design includes a reflective pool of water encircling the stadium, with fans crossing six bridges to reach it. The stadium is part of a project that will entirely construct the city of Lusail, which will include parks and marinas.  Its construction though has been condemned by Amnesty International, who are concerned that some workers are going unpaid. 9. Las Vegas Stadium, USA Capacity: 65,000 Due Date: 2020 Cost: Sh186 billion The Las Vegas stadium will be the new home of the Oakland Raiders, who will relocate from Oakland, California before the start of the 2020 season. The move was controversial but comes after years of searching for a new home away from the Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum, which is regarded as one of the worst grounds in the NFL. Their new home will be an indoor complex complete with a glass-domed roof, adjacent to the Las Vegas strip. But if any Raiders fans get too carried away they risk being locked up on-site, as the stadium’s design includes a jail and a courtroom. 10. Bernabeu redesign, Madrid Capacity: 81,044 (unchanged) Date Due: 2022 Cost: Sh66.5 billion Real Madrid announced plans for a wholesale renovation of the Bernabeu last month. The project, which according to President Florentino Perez could rake in an extra €150million (Sh13 billion) per season, will make the stadium become ‘more modern’ and ‘more secure’. The new-look Bernabeu will have a chrome finish and feature a retractable roof, new seats and two new towers.
