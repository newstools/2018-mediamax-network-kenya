PSCU and Felix Yegon @PeopleDailyKe President Uhuru Kenyatta  yesterday backed the establishment of regional blocs to tackle issues common to neighbouring counties and directed the Ministry of Devolution to formulate policy to guide such entities. He said the economic blocs would ensure counties benefit from economies of scale and help solve problems such as insecurity. Uhuru was speaking in Bomet town when he officially opened the inaugural investment conference of the Lake Region Economic Bloc (LREB). The bloc brings together 14 counties in the Lake Victoria region. “I assure you of my administration’s support and ask you to work closely to achieve the Kenyan dream,” he said. The region’s flagship projects include the establishment of a regional commercial bank, the deployment of Information and Communication Technology to improve service delivery, creation of a Lake Region Ring Road to improve road infrastructure and enhancement of tourism activities through the establishment of a Lake Region tourism circuit. Other plans are the improvement of healthcare by establishment of specialist hospitals in each of the member counties and and the establishment of an agricultural commodities exchange. “The thinking behind the establishment of the economic bloc and the packaging of the issues faced by the citizens in the member counties through the “Lake Region Economic Blueprint” is commendable and deserves support,” said Uhuru who was accompanied by Deputy President William Ruto. The President said the government would formulate frameworks to support county integration efforts. He further said that national government regional development authorities would be streamlined to fit into the new economic dynamics. At the same time, Uhuru warned against politicisation of management of water resources. “Water is the single most important natural resource. We cannot, therefore, afford to play divisive politics with it,” he said.
