Dinah Ondari @dinahondari Senators have raised concerns over rampant chaos pitting Members of County Assemblies (MCAs) and their Speakers. The legislators have now called on the County Assemblies Forum (CAF) to rein in what they termed   rogue MCAs who appear to have turned the guns on Speakers for unclear reasons. Led by chairman of the Senate Legal Affairs committee Samson Cherargey (Nandi), the legislators have now sought a meeting with leaders of CAF in a bid to find solution to the wrangles. “It is true we shall meet CAF to try to establish the source of the problem affecting the county assemblies and why there is anger against the Speakers,” said Cherargey. He was backed by his Makueni counterpart Mutula Kilonzo Jnr who challenged his colleagues to rise to the occasion and intervene, as the “ protectors of devolution.” “There is a problem in the County Assemblies. All the Speakers are on the verge of being dislodged and the committee on Justice should do something and help address the situation,” said Kilonzo Jnr. On Wednesday, Nyandarua Country Assembly adjourned its House Business  as rival MCAs clashed over leadership roles. Speaker Wahome Ndegwa was forced to adjourn after he failed to control MCAs from transacting the business of the day. A day before, chaos erupted in Kakamega and Homa Bay assembies following a protest by MCAs who levelled several accusations against their respective Speakers. In Kakamega, a fight broke out after some ward representatives barricaded the office of the Speaker Morris Buluma, using wooden planks and later declared they had “ousted” him from office. While in Homa Bay morning sittings at the County Assembly were on Wednesday delayed for more than 30 minutes after unknown people took away the mace from the Speaker’s office.
