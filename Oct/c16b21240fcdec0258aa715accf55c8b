Public Service Vehicle operators are bracing themselves for tougher times after the government issued  a two week ultimatum asking them to comply with the traffic act and the famous Michuki rules. A statement released by the ministries of transport and interior has directed operators of public service vehicles to ensure their vehicles are  fitted with speed governors, safety belts and bear a continuous yellow line. Drivers and  conductors have  also been asked  to wear uniform and display their photos as prescribed by the law.
