Noah Cheploen @cheploennoah A non-governmental organisation in Nakuru county has dismissed reports linking it to the resurgence of criminal gangs in parts of Central Kenya. Amani Sasa Foundation, founded by former Mungiki leader Maina Njenga (pictured), said the reports are false and aimed at tarnishing  its image. Addressing the press in Nakuru yesterday, spokesperson Martha Wanjiru said the group, which consists of born-again youths and community leaders from Eastern, Rift Valley and Central Kenya regions are working tirelessly to promote peace across the country in the spirit of the Handshake. “It is unfair for people to link our foundation to criminal activities of a gang causing trouble among residents of Central Kenya. Ours is a religious group and those making the allegations should cease with immediate effect,”she said. There are  claims the outlawed sect is recruiting school children in the area under new names to terrorise residents.
