Nyamira Members of the County Assembly (MCAs) have vowed hostility towards journalists if they don’t cover their activities positively. The MCAs told journalists to either cover them in positive light or risk being blocked from the Assembly precincts and covering live House business. The MCAs are reportedly angered by journalists, who have been exposing cases of corruption and other malpractices in the House in the last six months. Recently journalists raised issues on alleged corruption in the  construction of the county administration block worth Sh379 million. Led by Assembly Speaker Mofat Teya, the ward reps yesterday accused the journalists of ganging up with “political detractors to taint the House reputation”. Teya was accompanied by Charles Barongo (Bomwagamo), Charles Maroko (Gesima), Joseph Nyarango (Esise) and nominated members George Mosiori and Abel Mokaya. Area leaders led by Senator Okong’o Mong’are  had petitioned the EACC to investigate the criteria used to award  the project’s tender. Members of the public have also accused the MCAs of making unnecessary foreign trips. The journalists, under Nyamira Media Organisation, said no amount of harassment and intimidation would stop them  from  discharging their duties.
