Benard Gitau @benagitau Kenya National Union of Nurses (Knun) secretary general Seth Panyako and two other union officials were yesterday arrested over a botched strike by nurses at the Kenyatta National Hospital. Police pounced on Panyako when he tried to address nurses who had gathered outside the facility accusing the management of blocking their quest to join Knun. KNH insists all nurses belong to Kenya Union of Domestic, Hotels, Educational Institutions, Hospitals and Allied Workers (Kudheiha) and must first resign to join Knun. Panyako was initially held at KNH police post but later transferred to Kilimani Police Station. Speaking to People Daily, Panyako said police were holding him on allegations of mobilising nurses who were picketing accusing the management of ignoring their plight. But KNH communications manager Simon Ithai said Panyako was mobilising nurses for an illegal strike.
