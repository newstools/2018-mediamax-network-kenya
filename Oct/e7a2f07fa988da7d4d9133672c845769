Two legislators from Kitui county want the government to flush out Somali herdsmen who have encroached some parts of the area in search of water and pasture. Speaking after holding a closed-door security meeting with Kitui County Commissioner Samuel Kimiti yesterday, the legislators Nimrod Mbai (Kitui East) and Rachel Nyamai (Kitui South) said women and children have fled homes for fear of attacks. Mbai said the herdsmen had taken over watering points in Mutha and Mutomo areas as residents trek kilometres away in search of the precious commodity. “Majority Leader Aden Duale has been calling me to allow the camels to graze and drink water in the county following the prolonged dry spell in his area. I want to tell him that we shall not continue shouldering his burden,” said the MP. Mbai said tension has gripped the area with locals fleeing their homes and called for swift security intervention to avert a catastrophe because many of the farmers cannot tend their farms ahead of the October-December rain season.
