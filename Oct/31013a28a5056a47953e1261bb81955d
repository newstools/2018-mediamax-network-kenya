There is debate that for a football striker to break through the ranks and earn a call-up to the national team, he or she must demonstrate goalscoring abilities. That explains why most trainers of national teams globally monitor the rate of marksmanship of such players at their respective clubs with a view to including them in their line-up in a bid to get the desired results. Paradoxical that it is only in Kenya where the Golden Boot Award which keeps changing every year means nothing to national team selectors. For instance, the case of Kariobangi Sharks’ upcoming striker Eric Kapaito, who won the SportPesa Premier League (SPL) Golden Boot last weekend, lends credence to the observation that some of the country’s marksmen are increasingly being overlooked for national team duty. A layman’s opinion is that it would have behoved the selectors to try out Kapaito in Africa Cup of Nations qualifier against Ethiopia and subsequent fixtures but this was not the case. While Kapaito missed out on the national selection, it is a strikingly different case for Gor Mahia striker Jacques Tuyisenge, one of the two players who were second in the goal-scoring pecking order, as he has been drafted in Rwanda’s national team for the upcoming AFCON qualifier’s.
