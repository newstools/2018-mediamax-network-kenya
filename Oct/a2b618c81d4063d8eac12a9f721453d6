Bernice Mbugua @BerniceMuhindi Suspended National Land Commission Valuation and Taxation director Salome Munubi has filed an application in court seeking to halt her prosecution and that of chairman Muhammad Swazuri. Through lawyer Duncan Okubasu, the official claimed the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) relied on false information to charge her and 14 other officials. She accused NLC vice chairperson Abigael Mbagaya and  legal officer Brian Ikol of framing them. Munubi said the charges facing her and her co-accused are malicious and allegedly meant to settle scores between Swazuri and Mbagaya. She wants the court to restrain DPP from continuing with the case pending the hearing and determination of the application. Swazuri and other former NLC officials are accused of fraudulently awarding compensation for land meant for the standard gauge railway. They are out on bail.
