We’ve heard so much about bull fighting, cocks fighting and even wrestling. But have ever heard about goat fighting? Well, this might sound bazaar to some of us but not to these Chinese fellows. They are seen watching keenly and enjoying as the goats work out issues their way. About 200 goats participated in the sport which was held in Silian Village of Litai town in Yanggu County, east China’s Shandong Province. However, the rules were brutally simple, the goats will fight until one bleeds to death, runs off, or until the owner takes pity and withdraw the animal from the battle, handing the opponent victory.
