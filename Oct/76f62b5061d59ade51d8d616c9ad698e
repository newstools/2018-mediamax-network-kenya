The Kenya National Amputee Football team has every reason to smile after the government succumbed to pressure and assured the team of financial and moral support as they prepare to jet out late next week to Mexico. After camping at the ministry headquarters at Kencom House, for two days, Sports cabinet Secretary Rashid Echessa finally met the players where he assured them  nothing has changed about the trip .He directed the officials in the Accounts  department to speed up the trips  logistics that included availability of funds to enable smooth travelling arrangements. Earlier, the Kenya Amputee Football Federation (KAFF) had accused the Ministry of Sports of incompetency and dishonesty. The team led by the secretary Peter Oloo spent the better part of Tuesday and Wednesday at the ministry headquarters demanding money to enable them to travel to Mexico next week for the World Amputee tournament. The team is slated to jet out on October 23. Oloo, Polycarp Mboya (player-cum-president of Kenya Amputee Sitting Volleyball) and Charity Kamau, who is the president of KAFF thanked Echessa for intervening and handling the issue with a sober mind. Oloo said it was inhuman and unfair to ignore the teams travel plan considering most of the players who have been training at the Parklands Sports Club on empty stomach had travelled as far as from Kakamega, Kitale, Bomet, and Mombasa etc. They accused the ministry Secretary of Administration Kassim Farrah of being rude and arrogant during their two-day sojourn at the Kencom House. “This is  a team with great potential,We have three Kenya players who have travelled all the way from Turkey to beef up our team. They have used their own air ticket. Why can’t the ministry reciprocate and give  this team a chance to show their prowess ?” posed Oloo.
