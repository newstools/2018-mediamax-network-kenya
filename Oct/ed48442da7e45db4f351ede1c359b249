Impala and KCB will for the third straight year meet in the Impala Floodlit tournament final after prevailing in their semi-final matches on Saturday. KCB beat Impala 32-22 to claim last year’s final, a sweet revenge after the Gazelles had denied them the 2016 crown and both teams have an opportunity to make it two titles in three years when they meet in Saturday’s final. The bankers made eight changes for their 34-10 semi-final win over Homeboyz and it proved effective as they knocked out the deejays with four converted tries and three penalties. Kenyan international Darwin Mukidza opened the scoring with two penalties to put KCB ahead, a score which was extended after the break courtesy of Martin Owila. Homeboyz eighth-man man Steve Otieno powered his way to the try line in retaliation but his effort was cancelled by Ahmed Shaban with a converted try for a 20-5 lead. Centre Stafford Abeka and Peter Kilonzo roared for the bankers with two converted tries for their 34 points with Otieno’s second try not helping Homeboyz’s course. The second semi-final featuring the hosts and university side Strathmore Leos ended 20-18 in favour of Impala. Impala ran in three tries, a conversion and a penalty against Leos’ two tries, a conversion and two penalties. Impala took a 15-3 lead at the break but Strathmore upped the ante in the   in the second period to claw back, only losing by two points. Strathmore scrum half Gideon Makumi slotted in a penalty for a 3-0 lead which was overturned by Impala inside centre Paul Mutsami who scored a try, converted by Kenyan international Samul Oliech. Billy Omondi furthered Impala’s score to 15-3 with a corner try, a minute to the break. On resumption, Impala managed an unconverted try by Elvis Oroko while Strathmore had Albert Obura and Alex Maina to thank for reducing the arrears with scrum-half Gideon Makumi scoring a penalty.
