Alvin Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi Woman Representative Esther Passaris has faulted Governor Mike Sonko for sidelining her in making key county decisions. Addressing the press yesterday, Passaris accused Sonko of not heeding the building bridges call, which was started by President Uhuru Kenyatta and Nasa leader Raila Odinga. “I have had a lot of frustrations in my office; Sonko is always ignoring me. If you are trying to build bridges, start with elected leaders,” she said. Passaris said despite making efforts to work with the governor, her efforts have been futile as she is never invited to county events. She added that she has been proposing several projects to the County government but her proposals have always been trashed despite being projects of goodwill. Passaris said she has an investor from Netherlands who wants to put up a Sh10 billion recycling plant,  where more than 40,000 youths will get employment, but getting audience with Sonko has been a problem. “I have reached out to the governor numerous times but it’s not working. Why can’t he just listen to me?” she posed. She, however, pledged to continue fronting her proposals, which she says will make Nairobi a better city.
