Mathew Ndung’u and Oliver Musembi @PeopleDailyKe President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday vowed to leave a corruption-free and united Kenya that embraces all its tribes, races and religions at the end of his term. Speaking during the launch of M-Pesa Foundation Academy in Thika, Uhuru said he is committed to fully eradicate corruption. “I will ensure I leave a united and cohesive society and I will have won the war on corruption,” he said in a question and answer session with students. He said his government is committed to public-private partnerships (PPP) that will accelerate the achievement of the Big Four agenda to create employment opportunities for the youth. The President said private-public partnerships form strong founded pillars that will effectively propel his government agenda. Uhuru said his government will continue to support the education sector, adding that the Education ministry got the highest portion of the current financial year’s budget. “This year, we have allocated  Sh430 billion to Education. The money will go to supporting our schools and teachers as they nurture our young minds and learners,” he said. He said the government was looking forward to build more education facilities and to improve the existing ones, to make education affordable and most accessible to every Kenyan. He said the government will not allow any form of examination cheating, adding that the country needs a technical labour force from those who graduate from the technical and vocational colleges. “For those who will not make it to university, you have an opportunity to become great in the vocational world,” he said. Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohammed, who attended the event, said the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE)examinations have kicked off with zero malpractices cases. Former Vice President Moody Awori, among other leaders, attended the event.
