Irene Githinji and Michael Kwena @gitshee Interior Cabinet secretary Fred Matiang’i has issued a stern warning to those fanning hostilities in Marsabit county. He said the culprits would face the law regardless of their rank or status and urged residents to refrain from violence, saying no perpetrator would be spared. Matiang’i spoke yesterday at his Harambee House office when he met leaders from Marsabit, following the recent spate of sporadic inter-community clashes in the county. “We’re aware the clashes are partly triggered by political incitement and we will deal firmly and decisively with anyone found culpable,”  he said. Seven people lost their lives while scores were injured in ethnic clashes in the county during the weekend. The seven died in separate clashes in Shurr, North Horr sub-county and Kubi Qalo, Saku sub-county. More security officers have been deployed to the area to restore normalcy.
