Jericho All Stars are the new Super Eight Premier League champions after thrashing Rongai All Stars 7-0 in a one-sided match played at Camp Toyoyo grounds at the weekend. The emphatic win enabled Jericho garner an unsailable 64 points from 19 wins and seven draws to lift the coveted trophy with two matches to spare. Under the tutelage of former Harambee Stars and Thika United coach, James Nandwa, Jericho are now assured of the Sh500,000 winner’s prize from the league organisers Extreme Sports-limited. An elated Nandwa attributed the win to determination, discipline and hard work. “I am proud of the whole team this season, the consistency and determination has borne fruit. As a coach this title means a lot to me. It’s a way of giving back to the Jericho community who have been supportive of this team,” said Nandwa after their emphatic win. The new champions who had failed to lift the title for two consecutive years missing it by a whisker on both occasions, scored via Kelvin Ndung’u, Victor Walerah and Bundu Engo, all scoring twice each while defender Eddie Otieno also found the back of the net to hand Jericho the much deserved win. The bitter loss saw Rongai drop one place to settle at 11th on 31 points on the 16-team log. “It was a tough game, we panicked in the first half, lost concentration and got punished for it. If we had played according to the coaches instructions I believe the outcome would have been different. It has been a challenging season for us but we hope to fight till the end,” Elisha Dylan, captain of Rongai said after the embarrassing defeat. By dethroning West Conference side Kawangware United, Jericho becomes the second East Conference side to win the league after Kayole Asubuhi’s success in 2016.
