President Uhuru Kenyatta has once again reiterated his government’s commitment to ensuring the National examinations which kick off on Monday attain the highest level of integrity . Kenyatta warned that his government will take stern action against all parties who attempt to compromise the examination, this as he and the Deputy President William Ruto urged parents to stop exerting undue pressure on their children.
