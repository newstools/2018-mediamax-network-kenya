It’s the weekend good people! And what a week it has been… for Arsenal fans. These fans of the north London football club have been over the moon, quite literally (myself included). It has been a week that Arsenal fans have become — albeit unofficially — the noisiest creatures walking on planet. On the pitch, the club has been performing exemplary well, compared to previous seasons in recent years. Under the stewardship of Spanish manager, Unai Emery (since May, 2018), Arsenal seems totally rejuvenated. Their last defeat happened on the road in August this year in the hands of fellow Londoners, Chelsea. Since then, the Emirates outfit has progressed to win 11 matches in a row, an achievement that has all lifted the spirits of the club’s faithful across the world. We wait to see if Emery and his squad will continue with the remarkable performance, as they travel across the city to square it up with Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park in a 3.30pm-scheduled English Premier League clash this Sunday. Away from Arsenal shenanigans, this weekend we’ve got an interesting read for you, our valued reader. In our cover story, we delve in to the lifestyle of the Akorino Christian denomination. We look at how their lifestyle has been changing over the years to an extent that we now have… Akorino slay queens! Quite captivating, yeah? What more can I say… just flip the pages!
