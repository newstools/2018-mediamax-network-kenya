Irene Githinji @gitshee President Uhuru Kenyatta has assured the government has set clear policies to support Early Childhood Development (ECD) and education. He said the government will continue targeting children from vulnerable and disadvantaged backgrounds, adding that legal policies have improved management of pre-school education. The President said significant strides have been made in ECD, with enrolment in pre-school increasing from 2.7 million children in 2012 to 3.3 million last year. Similarly, the number of teachers trained for pre-school increased from 80,526 in 2012 to over 106,000 last year. Speaking when he opened the inaugural three-day ECD and education bringing together all African nations, Uhuru urged counties to support pre-school education, which is a devolved function. “Our target is to ensure all Kenyan children are able to attend ECD by the year 2020. Emphasis should be placed on multi-sectoral collaborations to maximise on the gains realised so far in the sector,” said Uhuru. The President added that the government has committed to realisation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), where boys and girls will have access to quality ECD and pre-primary education by 2030. The function was attended by Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed, her counterparts Fred Matiang’i (Interior) and Sicily Kariuki (Health) and Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko.
