Seth Onyango @SethManex John Gakuo, a University of Nairobi (UoN) graduate, served as provincial administrator for more than 20 years before joining Nairobi City’s leadership. He was appointed Town Clerk (effectively CEO) of the Nairobi City Council in 2004 and inspired by history – France’s recovery since WWI– believed Nairobi could be restored to its 1970s glory. He found the city choking from filth, which was attributed to lack of brooms. He instructed the staff to improvise brooms from tree branches and the clean-up began. He also addressed hawkers’ problem, traffic congestion, introduced modern public toilets, benches, flowers and trees. However, the cemetery scam unfolded in 2010 when the then Nairobi City Council bought land valued at Sh24 million at Sh283 million in an area rated as a far-flung wasteland bordering the southern fringes of Nairobi National Park. The scandal roped in the then Deputy Prime Minister Musalia Mudavadi when then Kenya Anti-Corruption Commission (KACC) commenced investigations to establish whether he was party to the fraud. Mudavadi protested the claims accusing KACC of being used by his detractors to dent his political career. Gakuo passed on yesterday morning at Mbagathi Hospital, Nairobi, where he was admitted on Monday following what medics termed as general ailment.  His appeal was due for hearing this morning. “Although it is too late, this case has to be heard to its logical conclusion and have his name cleared. Why deny him bail? He is not a flight risk. This is not how his life should have ended,” his successor at City Hall Philip Kisia said at Lee Funeral Home.
