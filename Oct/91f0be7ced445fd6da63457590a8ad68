DPPS @PeopleDailyKe Deputy President William Ruto has said investment in technical education remains key to successful implementation of the Big Four agenda. He said the Government is now focusing more on technical and vocational education, saying the move is aimed at helping students utilise their talents for the development of the country. Speaking during the launch of Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) curriculum at the Kenya Technical Trainers College in Nairobi yesterday, the DP said TVET had in the past been negatively profiled; yet the country’s development relies heavily on the sector. “Implementation of the Big Four agenda projects will heavily rely on institutions that produce TVET students. It is time we identify gifts of our children and give them an opportunity to exploit their talents in their field,” he said. Vocational and Technical Training Principal Secretary Kevit Desai said the government has done everything possible to make the sector attractive. He urged private sector and social sectors to work with TVET to meet innovation and competencies needs of the country. TVET Curriculum Development Assessment and Certification Council chief executive  Laurence Guantai said the country should move away from education that ensures that students only passed in examinations to one that gives them opportunity to utilise their talents.
