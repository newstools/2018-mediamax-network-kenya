Johannesburg, Wednesday @PeopleSports11 Liverpool star Mohamed Salah gets a chance to rediscover his scoring touch when he plays for Egypt against eSwatini (formerly Swaziland) in the Africa Cup of Nations this week. After notching 44 goals for the English Premier League club in all competitions last season, the 26-year-old has managed only three this season, and just one in eight games since August. When Salah last played for his country, he scored twice and missed two penalties as the record seven-time African champions romped to a 6-0 win over Niger during September. Niger are ranked 105 in the world 31 places above eSwatini so Egypt can realistically hope to score goals this Friday at the Al Salam Stadium in Cairo. Salah is the pride of Egypt having won the best goal and finished third in the best player category behind Luka Modric and Cristiano Ronaldo at the recent FIFA awards. He is also among 30 contenders for the Ballon d’Or prize bestowed annually by France Football magazine. His recent scarcity of goals for Liverpool, and being substituted in a match at Chelsea, has drawn sympathy from Egyptian pundits. “Salah must not look back at last season, whether it was his goal scoring or his exceptional form,” said Islam el-Shater in Al-Masry Al-Youm. “He must do what his manager (Jurgen Klopp) asks of him so that he does not lose his starting place.” Another columnist in that newspaper, Mohammed el-Bourmy, wrote: “Salah is being compared to Ronaldo and Messi and some possibly believed he could score 40 to 50 goals every season. “He is not required to do that, but rather to have a good season with 20 goals to his name and enjoy himself.” -AFP
