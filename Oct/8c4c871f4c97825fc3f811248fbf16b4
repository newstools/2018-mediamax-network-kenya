Former   Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta to intensify the war on graft and recover all the stolen cash. He said corruption has adversely affected development, adding that if not nipped in the bud, the President will not achieve  his Big Four agenda. The former governor said State should stop borrowing money that benefits few individuals. Speaking on the state of the nation at Kameme FM yesterday,  Kabogo said he fully supports calls for referendum to reduce the number of elected representatives. He said Kenyans are already overburdened, adding changes in the Constitution are not about leaders but common Kenyans who struggle to pay their representatives. “I am not afraid and people should stop taking referendum matters lightly. People should not tell us what and where we should go. We will follow where our hope is and I believe we will not be ordered to ‘lie low’,” he said.
