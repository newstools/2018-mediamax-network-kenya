Moscow, Wednesday President Vladimir Putin suggested Wednesday that Russia and Japan sign a peace treaty this year, ending World War II hostilities “without any preconditions” as a territorial dispute has led to decades of deadlock. But Putin’s sudden proposal was received cooly in Japan, where a government spokesman said the two countries should first resolve the dispute before signing a peace deal. The dispute between Russia and Japan centres on four islands in the strategically-located Kuril chain which the Soviet Union occupied at the end of war in 1945 but are claimed by Japan. It has kept the two countries from signing a peace accord that would formally end their wartime hostilities. “We have been trying to solve the territorial dispute for 70 years. We’ve been holding talks for 70 years,” Putin said at an economic forum in the far eastern Russian city of Vladivostok attended by Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese leader Xi Jinping. “Let’s conclude a peace agreement, not now but by year’s end without any preconditions,” Putin said, prompting the audience to break into applause. “It is not a joke,” Putin added, suggesting the two countries commit to solving the territorial dispute in the text of the peace deal. Putin said the conclusion of such a deal would create a better atmosphere and allow Russia and Japan to “continue to solve all outstanding issues like friends.”  -AFP
