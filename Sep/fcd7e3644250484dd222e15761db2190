The government has directed retailers to sell a 2kg packet of  flour at not more than 75 shillings and set the cost of a 90 kg bag of maize at 1,600 shs. Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri,said the move has been occasioned by the abundant supply of maize in the market with retailers expected to adjust their prices immediately.
