Njeri denied the charges and sought to be released on bond, saying she was unwell and needed medical attention. However, her application was opposed by the prosecution, arguing that the police are yet to conclude investigations. The magistrate in his ruling concurred with the prosecution side noting that the matter is a serious offence and directed the accused be remanded until October 2 for bond application.
