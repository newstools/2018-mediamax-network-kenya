The government has set up nine new centres to hasten the process of acquiring the new generation e-passports before the September 2019 global deadline.
Five centres are based in the country while the other four will cater for Kenyans in Europe, America and Middle East, this in a bid to beat the global deadline for the acquisition of the new passports.
