Muthaiga Golf Club’s Greg Snow held his nerve on the final day of the second leg of the Safari Tour Golf Series, that was held at the Vet Lab Sports Club, to fend off a mounting challenge from a resurgent Dimas Indiza to claim the tournament’s top prize. Snow finished 1-over par 73 for the round to take his total for the tournament to 6-under par 282; while Indiza shot an impressive 4-under par 68 for the final round to return a similar tally, and to tie for the lead. A three-hole playoff, on the Par-4, first, the uphill dogleg left Par-4, 17th and on the Par-4, 18th ensued to decide the winner of the tournament. Both made par on the first and 17th holes in the playoff, but a bogey on the 18th for Indiza and a par for Snow secured the latter’s lead. Sigona Golf Club’s Sujan Shah returned level par for the round to take his overall tally for the tournament to 3-Under Par 285 and finish third overall. For their efforts, Greg Snow took home Sh150,000; Indiza -Sh100,000 and Sujan claimed Sh80,000. Indiza said: “The first two days were not so good, but I picked my game in the finalrounds to force the playoff today. Overall, I am happy with my performance having won the Pro-Am on Saturday and having finished second here.
