Madrid, Thursday @PeopleSports11 Spain boss Luis Enrique has no issue with the lack of Barcelona players in the national side. Having managed at the Nou Camp between 2014 and 2017, Enrique has strong ties with the Catalan club but Real Madrid players now dominate the Spain line-up. In Tuesday’s 6-1 demolition of Croatia, Sergio Busquets was the only Barcelona representative and there were six Real players in the starting line-up. Enrique said: “I’m looking for balance. I didn’t know there were six Real Madrid players in the XI, neither do I care. They play for the Spanish national team, that’s it. They don’t play for one team or another. Our base is from Real Madrid and it looks good to me.” “No-one from Barcelona? I only see a shirt, the national team’s one. Qualification? We still have to beat England and Croatia again,” he added. Historically, Barcelona and Real Madrid have provided the lion’s share of players for La Roja. Gerard Pique was a fixture in the line-up but retired from international football following the World Cup, further thinning the Barcelona cohort available. Rodrigo and Jose Luis Gaya, both from Valencia, started against Croatia along with Saul of Atletico Madrid and David de Gea of Manchester United. Isco, Dani Ceballos, Marco Asensio, Sergio Ramos, Nacho and Dani Carvahal were the Real stars on show. If Spain continue to play as they did against the World Cup runners-up, not even the most hardened Barcelona supporters will be able to complain about the lack of representation.   -DAILYMAIL
