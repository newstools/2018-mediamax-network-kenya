The congestion of patients at the Mama Lucy Hospital is likely to come to an end in the next three months after the Nairobi county government revived the construction of a 1.1 billion shillings block that had stalled more than two years ago.
Construction of the six storey building began in 2013 but stalled 3 years later due to underfunding by the Ministry of Health after spending  Sh141 million for phase one of the project.
