Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko on Thursday set up a free medical camp in honour of his late father Gideon Kioko Mbuvi Kivanguli. Hundreds of patients suffering from chronic diseases benefitted from the free medical camp at Kathiani Primary School, which is opposite Sonko’s Mua Hills Home. The two-day free medical camp is in remembrance of Mzee Kivanguli’s third anniversary since his demise. Sonko said the medical camp is to help families that cannot afford medical facilities due to financial challenges. He urged the sick members of the public to turn out in large numbers. “I really value human life. When my late father was alive, he used to talk a lot about the importance of good health and education. Therefore, by setting up this  free medical camp is a dedication to our late father,” he said. Peter Kioko, one of the patients who turned up for the camp, said he was so grateful. “I’m very grateful to Governor Sonko for offering us the medical aid. I was suffering from typhoid, but I’ve now been given drugs and I’m now hopeful that I’ll recover soon,” said Kioko.
