New York, Sunday Serena Williams’ furious outburst at umpire Carlos Ramos overshadowed her US Open final defeat by Naomi Osaka at Flushing Meadows on Saturday night. Initially unhappy about being penalised for coaching from the stands, Williams was then given a point penalty for smashing her racket before Ramos took a game away from her after she called him a ‘thief’. Meanwhile, Japan on Sunday hailed Osaka’s stunning upset against the legendary Williams, giving the nation some rare good news after a summer of deadly natural disasters. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe led the praise, taking to Twitter to congratulate Osaka after her 6-2, 6-4 win in New York. “Congratulations on your victory at the US Open. The first Japanese player to win a Grand Slam title. Thank you for giving energy and inspiration to the whole of Japan,” the premier tweeted. Below is the entire transcript of what the American said to the umpire on a controversial evening inside the Arthur Ashe Stadium. -Agencies
