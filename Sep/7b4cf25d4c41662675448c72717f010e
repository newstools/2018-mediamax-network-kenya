Nairobi Gov. Mike Sonko has set up a task force to investigate the root cause of management and financial problems at Pumwani Maternity Hospital. This comes after the expose on infant bodies found stored in polyethene bags and boxes at the facility, after Sonko made an impromptu visit at the facility upon receiving complaints about laxity and negligence from members of the public.
