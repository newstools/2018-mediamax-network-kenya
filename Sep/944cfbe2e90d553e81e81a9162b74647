Migori Governor Zachary Okoth Obado will be spending another two nights in custody after Justice Jessie Lessit  ordered his continued detention at  the industrial area remand prison pending the hearing and determination of his bail application on Thursday afternoon. And as Grace Kuria reports, the state has applied to the court  seeking to amend the charges facing him to include the murder of the 7month unborn baby of Rongo University student Sharon Otieno.
