 The government has issued a 90 day moratorium to all  civilians in possession of firearms to undergo fresh vetting and verification of their licenses. A statement issued by the ministry of interior has also directed all individuals in possession of prohibited firearms to immediately surrender them to the government or risk  prosecution. The move comes barely a week after the government reconstituted the firearms licensing board citing massive irregularities in the licensing of firearms to civilians most of which are being used to commit crimes.
