St Antony’s and Moi Girls Nangili will represent Kenya in the inaugural Under-16 Copa Coca-Cola African Cup of Nations football tournament set to take place from December 10-15 in Nakuru. Both teams qualified for the continental event after winning the National Secondary Schools Sports Association (KSSSA) games title and will now have to contend with strong competition from regional rivals. St Antony’s will battle it out with a team from Ethiopia in the opening match while Nangili face Zimbabwe, the only other girls team in the competition. With 10 boys’ teams taking part, a Zimbabwean side will take on a team from Mozambique as Uganda’ representatives lock horns with their Malawian counterparts. Nigerian representatives will then take on their Zambian colleagues as South Africans face off with Angola. A side from Kenya’s neighbours Tanzania will cross swords with a Botswana team with organisers hoping to see talents tapped and nurtured especially since there will be different coaches and scouts in attendance.
