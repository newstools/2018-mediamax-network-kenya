Interior Cabinet Secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i has refuted claims that the government has run out of material to produce the new police uniform saying those were plans by a cartel to run propaganda in order to force the government to import the uniform. According to Matiang’i, the government had already procured and paid for a sufficient number of uniforms for the officers. Matiang’i was speaking during a meeting with transport stakeholders to deliberate the streamlining of the bodaboda industry.
