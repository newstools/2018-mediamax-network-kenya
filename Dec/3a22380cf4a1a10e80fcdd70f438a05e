Embakasi South MP, Julius Mawathe has called for stiffer penalties to be imposed on men who impregnate school going children. Speaking when commissioning a dormitory at Embakasi Girls High School, Mawathe said the cases had increased and it was time such men were castrated as punishment for their crimes. In the just concluded national exams, the number of girls who sat their exams either having delivered or still pregnant had gone up, prompting a national outcry.  Mawathe, who’s constituency is part of Mukuru kwa Njenga slums and largely composed of the poor in society said girls in his constituency were mostly affected as monied men lured them into having unprotected sex.
