Several families were Tuesday rendered homeless after 10 storey houses allegedly built on a disputed 20 acre piece of land were brought down in Nyama-Villa estate in Komarock area in Nairobi. The houses were demolished after the owner of the disputed piece of land obtained a court order to pull down the buildings following a legal tussle lasting over ten years.
