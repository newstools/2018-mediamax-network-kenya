The Transport Licensing Appeals Board(TLAB) has concluded over 70 cases between the National Transport and Safety Authority, NTSA and Public Service Vehicle (PSV) owners. The board mandated to resolve court cases has now moved to Narok to resolve a case in which Narok Line Sacco has petitioned the tribunal to take up a matter in which NTSA failed to address. Iin the memorandum of appeal Narok Line Sacco is seeking to detach itself from Narok Star due to wrangles that have been occurring due to operation space. At the same time Narok Line Sacco has called on the tribunal to have Narok county government issue business permits and parking spots at bus stops. According to the tribunal chairman Dick Waweru, seventy five cases linking NTSA and matatu operators have been resolved since 2017. He however noted that matatu saccos should not suffer in silence, adding that the cases cost only 2000 shillings for the saccos.  The tribunal will finalize on hearing the grievances on Monday.
