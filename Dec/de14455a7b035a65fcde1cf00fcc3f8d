President Uhuru Kenyatta has vowed to block attempts by Members of Parliament to award themselves hefty allowances and benefits through the parliamentary service bill. Speaking during a  tour of Kiambu county where he officially launched the Rais Mashinani initiative, the president lashed out at the move by MPs terming it selfish and inconsiderate. The president  spoke as the simmering differences between Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu and woman representative Gathoni Wamuchomba played out in the open.
