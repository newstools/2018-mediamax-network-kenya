Irene Githinji @gitshee Education Cabinet secretary Amina Mohamed has warned secondary schools against charging students joining Form One next year illegal levies. Amina said charging illegal levies will be treated as a crime of corruption and measures taken against the culprits. She said cases of lethargy with this vice on the part of education officials will also be dealt with decisively. The CS reassured parents and guardians who have reported such cases that the ministry is taking the relevant action against the affected schools saying victimisation of learners, parents and guardians who engage the ministry as a result of illegal levies by schools will not be tolerated. “Parents are advised to only pay the amount in the fees structure and report incidents of any students turned away for not paying higher fees to their respective regional education coordinators, county directors of education for action,”   said Amina. And as far as Free Day Secondary Education  is concerned, Amina said all learners in public day schools receive Sh22,244 yearly. She also said all Form One entrants next year will also be supplied with new core text books akin to the 2018 class. Students reporting to public secondary schools in January 2019 will be the second group to benefit from the National Hospital Insurance Fund cover that commenced in May this year.
