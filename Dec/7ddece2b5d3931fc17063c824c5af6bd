Bernard Gitau and Anthony Mwangi @PeopleDailyKe The Federation of Public Transport Operators is calling for protests against the ban of Public Service Vehicles (PSVs) from the city centre. Matatu Owners Association (MOA) chairman Simon Kimutai accused Governor Mike Sonko of taking knee jerk reaction to traffic menace in the city and urged him to  suspend the directive immediately. The operators made the calls even as lawyer Evans Ondieki advised individual members of matatu saccos, corporate and organisations to sue the county government. “This is an arbitrary order forced onto the people without consultations as per the constitution. The sector has lost at least Sh500 million through time wastage, fatigue and mental suffering,” said Ondieki. At the same time, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has asked the Nairobi county government to hold talks with the public transport stakeholders and urban transport experts to find an amicable solution to the crisis. He said this will ensure planners put in place alternatives which are efficient and affordable to the more than two million working population in the city and who are key to the country’s economic growth. And the Kenya Alliance of Resident Association (KARA) has called on the Nairobi County government to suspend the ban on Matatu to access the CBD saying it had caused serious socio-economic harm to the city. “Apart from not effectively addressing the congestion problem in the CBD, the decision to ban matatus from the city centre has brought serious and negative implication on commuters especially as regards security, cost and convenience,” said KARA Chief executive Henry Ochieng. He urged authorities to focus attention on a comprehensive urban transport master plan that will prescribe a holistic solution to the problem.
