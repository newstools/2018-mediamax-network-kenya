The association backing CS Matiangi’s saying  local factories  have the capacity to produce the  fabric and that  various manufacturers  had since been vetted  and production of the   fabric   was  underway. This coming a day after interior cabinet secretary Dr. Fred Matiang’i, claimed  certain known influential cartels were trying to manipulate  the government to import the uniforms .
