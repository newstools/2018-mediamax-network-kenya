A Mombasa court was stunned yesterday when another man claimed to be the biological father of an eight-month-old baby who had allegedly been sold by her mother. James Kimani, a driver  plying the Mishomoroni-Mwembe Tayari route, interrupted proceedings before Shanzu Principal magistrate Diana Mochache and moved towards the magistrate claiming he had secretly sired the baby with Joyce Wairimu, who is married to Peter Kairu. This is after Mochache asked the whereabouts of the minor’s father to enable the court to reach a decision on whose custody the baby should be handed to. Relatives and family members murmured in low tones over the whereabouts of Kairu who has all along been believed to be the baby’s father. However, Mochache quickly ruled that the minor was too young to recognise its father and immediately ordered it be placed at Mji wa Salama children’s home awaiting further orders. “The minor is too young to express herself and as such I issue orders for State to have her rescued to a safe children home, and the father to ensure provision of her basic needs and attendance of clinic,” she said. It further emerged that Kimani was married to the second suspect, Margaret Kihiko, who is alleged to have bought the baby and ferried her from Mombasa to Molo. Wairimu, Kihiko and the third accused Susan Nyambura pleaded not guilty to five counts of stealing a baby, conspiracy to defeat justice, interference with witnesses and compounding a felony. Mochache ordered the suspects  detained for five days to enable police to complete investigations and for the first accused to undergo mental test to ascertain if she was of sound mind. The matter will be mentioned on December 20.
