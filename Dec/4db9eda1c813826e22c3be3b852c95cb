Director of Public Prosecutions Noordin Haji yesterday lost bid to have National Land Commission chairman Muhammad Swazuri barred from accessing his office. This is after Justice Hedwig Ong’udi of the Anti-Corruption Court directed the DPP to argue his appeal at the Court of Appeal. “Since the DPP is dissatisfied with the court’s ruling dated November 1, the best court is the Court of Appeal where it can rule on whether they have an arguable case or not. I disallow the application by DPP,” ruled the judge. DPP through Alexander Muteti wanted the court to suspend a decision that allowed Swazuri (pictured) back to office pending the hearing and determination of the intended appeal. Muteti argued that immunity to criminal proceedings is only extended to the President. The prosecution wanted Swazuri restrained from accessing his office since his trial over abuse of office at the magistrate court is yet to proceed. Swazuri has on the other hand objected to the application insisting the court has no jurisdiction to grant the orders sought.
