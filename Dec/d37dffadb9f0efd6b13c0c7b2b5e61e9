Paul Kiarie led Public Hero to a dominant win in the feature 1,400m Mzee wa Pwani Trophy, trouncing the Patsy Sercombe stable at Ngong Racecourse on Sunday. In the race recorded at 1:25:09 seconds, Kiarie started with a bang and secured pole position for the entire meet. At the rear was the attacking trio from Sercombe stable in X-Factor, Pharaoh’s Advocate and Navy Seal who had a strategy to neutralise any threats. However, the plans fizzled out as the pace of Public Hero was too much and the tactics at play were exemplary from the pair that is trained by Onesmus Mutua. Leslie Sercombe came in second, three-and-half lengths behind in a titanic battle at the hard tracks. At the bend, X-Factor, which was ridden by Sercombe, came mighty close but the South African breed just bolted faster to claim its 10th win inside 26 starts. Sercombe stable-mate Richard Kibet sauntered in third atop Pharaoh’s Advocate which won the meet last year. Heavyweight Western Ballad seemed rusty and only managed fifth in a day to forget for veteran jockey Daniel Tanui. Meanwhile, Henry Muya won the 1,600m Halls Handicap race atop Galileo Star ahead of Fast Five of Leslie Sercombe. The race, timed at 1:40:04, saw shifting of positions inside the first 1,200m before the real showdown was witnessed. Muya powered the South African breed fillie from the wide lane while Sercombe was lurking dangerously next, not leaving a chance for a wide gap. However, Galileo Star won the battle in bruising fashion after crossing the finish line quickest. In the short Christmastide Handicap (1,000m), Macushla jockeyed by Peter Kiarie, cruised to a six-gap win in what was a solitary race from the start from the South African breed. Romeo Foxtrot, ridden by Muoki Kiilu, finished second.
