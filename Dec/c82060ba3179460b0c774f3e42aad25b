Barry Silah and Viden Ochieng @PeopleSport11 FC Talanta began their 2018/2019 National Super League season by humbling newcomers Eldoret Youth 3-1 at Camp Toyoyo grounds yesterday. Kelvin Chieti ran into a speculative pass from Dennis Injendi to slot home from close range for an early advantage to Eldoret. The goal unsettled Talanta who poured numbers up front in search of an equaliser. In the 29th minute, the lively Rodgers Omondi was sent through by left back Job Tinyo for a Talanta attack but his final ball did little to trouble Richard Eberyo on goal. Three minutes later, Talanta’s Sebastian Osodo teed Mokaya with a delightful pass but Martin Muchiri fluffed it. In the 43rd minute, Martin Muchiri lobbed the ball into space for Omondi to race clear and beat Eberyo in goal for Talanta’s equaliser. Kisumu stalemate Eldoret were starved off spaces as Talanta took control in the second half and in the 61st minute, Ronny Katumanga unleashed a shot from the right flank to make it 2-0 before skipper Sebastian Osodo powered home the third off a corner from Abdul Adam. Elsewhere, Wazito FC beat Nairobi City Stars 2-0 at Hope Centre while Green Commandoes stunned Modern Coast 2-1 at Mbaraki grounds. Meanwhile, Administration Police (AP) and Kisumu Allstars played to a 1-1 draw at Moi Stadium in Kisumu.  The law enforcers took the lead in the 10th minute after Alfred Achole tapped in Julius Muteti’s cross to make it 1-0 at half-time. The hosts, however, were to wait up to the 82nd minute when Davis Aola equalised. “We had prepared for a win but the draw is equally good at this stage as we are taking each game at a time,” said AP coach Samson Gitau.
