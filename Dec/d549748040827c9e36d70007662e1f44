Eric Juma @PeopleDailyKe Siaya County government books of account will be audited before Christmas,  Senate Public Accounts Committee chairman Moses Kajwang’ has said. He said in the next Senate session, he will mobilise his committee to pay Siaya government a visit and do a thorough audit of the accounts and give recommendations on the status of the expenditures. Speaking during a fundsdrive in aid of construction of Yenga Catholic Church in Ugenya, the senator said his mission to audit is not pegged on witchhunt but to ascertain facts on expenditure and whether funds remitted to the county were being used as planned. “I have toured Siaya for funddrives this weekend and have heard  MCAs pushing for audit of the accounts and have talked to Senator James Orengo who has endorsed the proposal that is why I will be here with other senators to establish if the county legislators’ outcry is genuine,” he said. MCAs’ outcry Kajwang’, who was accompanied by  Narok Senator Ledama ole Kina  and MPs Elisha Odhiambo (Gem), Chris Karan (Ugenya), Gideon Ochanda (Bondo) and Siaya Speaker George Okode, said he will be responding to the outcry of the MCAs who feel Governor Cornel Rasanga is out to sabotage them. Orengo said he would convene separate meetings with MCAs and Governor Rasanga before the Senate’s visit   to discuss and iron out issues raised. “We won’t accept a scenario that will derail operations of the county as that will hurt the beneficiary of devolution and that is why I have decided to organise a meeting with MCAs to broker the stalemate that has hindered passage of the supplementary issues. Odhiambo urged the MCAs to dialogue with Rasanga and find a middle ground to work together harmoniously instead of  chest thumping saying this  will make things worse.
