Nairobi Governor Mike Sonko yesterday clashed with senators over the manner in which he has been firing County Executive Committee (CEC) members. Members of County Public Accounts Committee (CPAIC) chaired by Otieno Kajwang’ asked Sonko (pictured) to carry out due diligence before undertaking such an exercise. The senators regretted that the CEC’s working in Nairobi county were living in fear as they do not have security of tenure. Kajwang’ told Sonko he is not a superman to perform all the roles of the county and thus has to give his CECs an opportunity to do their job.
