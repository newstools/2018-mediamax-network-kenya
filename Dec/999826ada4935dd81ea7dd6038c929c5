The World was today commemorating the World AIDS Day with respective governments and non- state actors assessing the milestones made and challenges in combating the disease. The theme of this year’s event being ” know your status” with an aim of encouraging more people to go for HIV/AIDS testing to enable them make informed decisions  on their health and help reduce the risk of transmission. Statistics by the UN AIDS Organization- UNAIDS,  indicates that 9.4 million people do not know their HIV status posing a major threat to the fight against the disease a situation that has been compounded by  social stigma especially among men  who  are reluctant to go for testing.
