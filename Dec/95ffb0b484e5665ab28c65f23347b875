Abuja, Monday Nigeria’s President Muhammadu Buhari has denied rumours that he had died and had been replaced by a look-alike. Some people thought he had been cloned, “but it’s the real me, I assure you,” Buhari (pictured) said. Rumours that he had been replaced with a body double called “Jubril” from Sudan had been widely shared online. The 76-year-old Buhari, who is seeking re-election in February next year, has been beset by ill health since taking office in 2015. He was on “medical leave” in the UK for three months in 2017. He revealed after his return to Nigeria that “I have never been so sick”, but did not disclose what he was suffering from. He insists he is now in good health. According to an AFP Fact Check investigation the rumours began late last year and have appeared on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube. Buhari, who is in Poland attending a UN climate change conference, was asked about the rumours during a meeting on Sunday with Nigerians in the country. He said those spreading rumours were ignorant and irreligious. “A lot of people hoped that I died during my ill health. Some even reached out to the vice-president to consider them to be his deputy because they assumed I was dead. -AFP
