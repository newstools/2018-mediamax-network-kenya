George Kebaso @Morarak The Council of Governors (CoG) has demanded immediate restoration of West Pokot Governor John Lonyangapuo security detail. Chairman Josphat Nanok said the withdrawal of the Governor’s security personnel demonstrates a clear conflict between discharge of public duties and fulfillment of personal interests, whether directly or indirectly. Inspector General of Police  Joseph Boinnet withdrew Lonyangapuo’s security detail on Friday after an altercation with police manning a roadblock on the Kapenguria-Lodwar highway last Wednesday. Police harassment Reports say the Governor stormed the roadblock and freed a boda boda rider allegedly arrested for flouting traffic rules. “The Inspector-General must take action on this matter, and seek to formally communicate to the Governor and immediately replace the officers. The actions witnessed must not be repeated ever again,” he said. The Governor accused police of harassing and extorting  from the rider before he managed to free the operator. In the past one month, motorists have reported harassment by traffic police officers following the rejuvenation of the Michuki rules last month by Interior Cabinet secretary, Fred Matiang’i. Tension was high in Makutano town after the residents learned that their Governor’s security detail had been withdrawn.
