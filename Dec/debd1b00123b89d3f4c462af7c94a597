Milan, Inter Milan’s Argentina striker Mauro Icardi won the Serie A
Footballer of the Year award at the Gran Gala del Calcio ceremony in
Milan on Monday night. The 25-year-old becomes the first player outside Juventus to win the
Italian Players’ Association award, voted for by his peers, since
Zlatan Ibrahimovic with AC Milan in 2011. Icardi was joint top scorer with Lazio’s Ciro Immobile in Serie A last
season with 29 goals. The Argentine also won the best goal award for his spectacular
backheel during a four-goal haul against Sampdoria last March. Icardi disagreed with the choice, insisting his “one (goal) at AC
Milan was more beautiful”. Juventus were voted top team with Massimiliano Allegri winning coach
of the year after the Turin side won a league and Cup double for the
fourth consecutive year. “It’s a group of great men, with a great club behind us,” said
Allegri, who has won the award four times. “I’m fortunate to have worked with so many marvellous players and
tonight I see the maestro Andrea Pirlo too.” Allegri’s side are on track for an eighth straight Serie A title, with
Allegri hailing the impact of five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano
Ronaldo who arrived last summer. “Ronaldo has brought professionalism, competitiveness and is a humble
guy,” said Allegri. Portuguese star Ronaldo finished runner-up to Croatia’s Luka Modric in
this year’s Ballon d’Or prize which was awarded in Paris on Monday. Fiorentina’s Italian international defender Alia Guagni won the Serie
A women’s Player of the Year award. Roma legend Francesco Totti and former AC Milan and Juventus great
Pirlo both received Lifetime Achievement Awards. Meanwhile, Gianluca Rocchi won the award for the best referee 24 hours
after being whistled off the pitch at the Stadio Olimpico over his
decision not to award Roma a penalty in a 2-2 draw against Inter
Milan.
