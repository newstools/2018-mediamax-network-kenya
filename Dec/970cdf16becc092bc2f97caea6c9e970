However, I would like to wish the entrants the best of luck and I’m sure they will enjoy the event and drive flat out as always,” said Sohan, one of the fastest rising KNRC youngsters from.the ever green MMC stable. Naushad, who is seeking to recuperate the MMC title, had this to say: ‘It will be quite exciting to recapture the title on homestretch, and a great pleasure reuniting with Adnan. Our Subaru project has indeed come to fruition and I wish to thank the team for their dedication and levelheadedness.” Also in the MMC night rally mix is the Subaru GC8 Team  DnA duo.DnA duo of Arjun and Dinesh are currently working round the clock to complete the double Subaru N10 project well in time for the 2019 season.
