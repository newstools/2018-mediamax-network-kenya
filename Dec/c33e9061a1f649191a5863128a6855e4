Dagoreti Children’s Home had the rare opportunity to host Diamond Platnumz and his Wasafi team, who paid them a visit and donated foodstuff, and clothes in a bid to give hope to the young and joyful souls. The team also urged Kenyans to continue sharing with the less privileged in  society during the festive season.
