General Service Unit (GSU) men were on Monday night crowned Kenya Volleyball Federation (KVF) champions after successfully defending the title in an unbeaten run from the regular season through to the playoffs. With the win, the paramilitary side will be at next years’ Africa Club championship and they are looking to improve on their fifth position this year and Kenya on the continental map when it comes to men’s volleyball. Coach Gideon Tarus says it took commitment, discipline and proper preparations to retain the title with a young squad and the same can help them leave a mark on the continental front. “Our exploits in this year’s championships were great motivation for retaining the title as we wanted a chance to better our standings at the continental competition. We had finished 17th in 2017 and friendly matches against some top clubs helped in our improved performance,” said Tarus. The coach who has been with GSU since the 2009 league playoffs taking over from Moses Epoloto at the time, believes that more friendly matches against top African or other international teams will give them an edge over their continental compatriots when the championships throw off. “Playing locally will not help us in the Africa championship. We cannot realise our mistakes and weaknesses if we keep winning. We already have invites for several tournaments on our table but they have to be vetted by the management and hopefully we will start our preparations in January,” added Tarus. The tactician praised his youthful squad for proving their mettle throughout the season and delivering the title. He had David Kirwa and Alex Kariuki on his bench as the most experienced players but says he stuck with his youngsters as the exposure and self belief will help them become better players.
