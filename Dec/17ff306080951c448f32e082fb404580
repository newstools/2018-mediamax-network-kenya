Kariobangi Sharks upset the form-book after they edged out SportPesa Premier League (SPL) champions Gor Mahia 1-0 in the Football Kenya Federation (FKF) Super Cup match at Kasarani Stadium yesterday. Hungry K’Ogalo Fast-rising striker Sydney Lokale’s opportunistic strike in the second half was all Sharks needed to bruise the egos of the dominant but wasteful Gor. K’Ogalo’s hunger for goals was discernible as early as the fifth minute when Burundian import Francis Mustafa forced Sharks’ goalkeeper Brian Bwire to a top drawer save. Four minutes later, Shaffique Batambuze made a dizzying run on the flank and put through Bernard Ondiek whose volley was easily picked by Bwire. However, it was not Gor all through as Sharks made a retaliatory attack, James Mazembe eluding his markers before his power-packed shot was saved by K’Ogalo goalkeeper Boniface Oluoch. Earlier on in the first half, Gor fans were up on their feet anticipating a goal only for Mustafa to misfire from 10 yards out after outwitting Sharks defender Geoffrey Shiveka. No impact The introduction of Boniface Omondi for George “Blackberry” Odhiambo added punch in Gor’s striking force but try as they would, they could not break Sharks’ defence in which Shiveka was outstanding. Sharks coach William Muluya lauded his charges for a splendid performance, saying the win was a big morale boost head of their away CAF Confederations Cup return match against Arta Solar of Djibouti. “I’m glad that my players showed a lot of character against a very big team like Gor. Obviously, we were not expecting an easy match and the outcome is bound to give the players a lot of confidence as we prepare to face Arta in Djibouti,” said Muluya. He added: “I’m excited that we have had exceptional goal scoring instincts lately which has been our driving force.”
