The golden labrador who worked as a service dog for President George HW Bush has been pictured resting beside his coffin, in a moving tribute. Bush, who served as the 41st US president between 1989 and 1993, died late on Friday at the age of 94. Sully the dog will be travelling with the casket on the flight from Texas to Washington DC on Monday. Bush’s body is due to lie in state this week ahead of a day of national mourning. Social media users thanked Sully for his services and commented on his and dogs’ loyalty generally towards their owners. -BBC
