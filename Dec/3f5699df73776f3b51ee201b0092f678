Mwangi Willy @PeopleDailyKe The Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK) Archbishop Jackson ole Sapit has urged MPs to reject a bill seeking to increase their perks. Speaking in Kitale, Sapit said passing the Parliamentary Service Commission Bill would be a burden to Kenyans who have been hard hit by high cost of living occasioned by an 8 per cent tax levy on petroleum products. “I call on Parliament to reject the bill since passing it would be an extra burden to Kenyans who are still coming to terms with new tax levies,” he said at the sidelines of a Kenya Anglican Men Association conference in Kitale. The bill has also been opposed by President Uhuru Kenyatta and opposition leader Raila Odinga who have called on MPs to be responsive to the plight of Kenyans by rejecting the proposed law. The bill, which is set for third reading this week, seeks to increase the MPs’ perks which include car loans, house allowances, insurance cover and a special kitty in each of the constituencies for evaluation of National government projects. The archbishop also appealed to the Judiciary not to exercise leniency on perpetrators of teenage pregnancies.
