Seth Onyango @SethManex Kirinyaga will host the sixth devolution conference in March next year, with the Big Four agenda set to dominate the forum. Enhancing the blue economy is also lined up for discussion as counties look for ways to harness aquatic assets to stimulate development. Kiranyaga Governor Anne Waiguru yesterday said counties are also keen to expand manufacturing sector with an aim to promote value addition to local products while at the same time creating employment opportunities. Speaking at the ongoing County Executive Committee Members (CECs) meeting in Nairobi, Waiguru said the Council of Governors is working toward enhanced economic partnerships among counties. “We want to identify areas where each county is strong and borrow from each other,” she said. She said counties have aligned their economic blueprints with President Uhuru Kenyatta’s Big Four agenda which will guide the discussions at the conference. “CoG will focus on addressing issues that will lead towards affordable and innovation practices in the provision of housing and infrastructure development in attainment of sustainable development,” said Waiguru. Governors are also keen to achieve food and nutrition security for all Kenyans by encouraging large-scale commercial farming and crop diversification.
