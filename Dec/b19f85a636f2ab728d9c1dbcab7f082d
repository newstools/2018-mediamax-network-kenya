Bernice Mbugua and Mercy Mwai @PeopleDailyKe Nairobi governor Mike Sonko yesterday said the ban on Public Service Vehicles (PSV) from the Central Business District (CBD) will continue. He told Nairobians to be patient as he executes his plan to decongest the city centre.  “We have to restore order in Nairobi county, if we agree to this matatu madness, hawking business, bodabodas, then we are not helping at all,” he said. He also dismissed claims that public hearings were not done and urged senator Johnson Sakaja to “offer solutions to the current mess instead of going to court on flimsy grounds”. Appearing before the Senate Public Accounts and Investments Committee (CPAIC), Sonko said the county government was considering using National Youth Service (NYS) vehicles to transport people living with disabilities, the elderly and the sick to their destination. He has been summoned to appear before senate committee on roads and transportation chaired by Kimani Wamatangi tomorrow. At the same time, the High Court yesterday declined to suspend the ban. Justice Pauline Nyamweya said she needed to hear all parties first since the gazette was published more than six months ago and has never been challenged. She, however, certified the cases, which were filed separately by Senator Sakaja and 21 matatu Sacco’s, as urgent and directed them to serve the petition to the respondents for hearing on Thursday. Sakaja has sued the County Government, Governor Sonko and Mohamed Dagane, the Nairobi County Transport executive. The 21 PSV Saccos on the other hand have sued the County government, National Transport and Safety Authority and the National Police Service. Sakaja argues that the gazette notice denying the Matatus access to the CBD did not take into consideration all the needs, challenges and constraints of public transport users. The saccos claim the decision is discriminative and was made unilaterally and without consultations with stakeholders.
