Members of the National Assembly yesterday accused the media of misrepresenting facts in a bill to insinuate they were seeking a pay hike. Leader of Majority Aden Duale, his Minority counterpart John Mbadi and Minority Whip Junet Mohamed kicked off the debate, saying the Parliamentary Service Commission Bill does not call for increase of MPs salaries and blamed journalists for allegedly peddling rumours and propaganda. Duale  challenged the media to read the bill and understand the bill before perpetuating “the greed narrative”. “What we read in the media nowadays is propaganda. They are no longer professional,” said Mbadi. On his part, Junet said: “The media has gone to the extent of misleading both President Uhuru Kenyatta and Opposition leader Raila Odinga on the bill.  Today I explained to Raila what the Bill entails and he could not believe.” His claims follows Uhuru and Raila’s sharp criticism of MPs’ bid increase their perks. The members denied ever attempting to increase their allowances despite a report by the Justice and Legal Committee clearly outlaying their demands. The report has included a new clause which seeks to “enable the members discharge their responsibilities effectively and for efficient functioning of Parliament to make  available…medical cover, official transport and suitable accommodation for Speakers and Leader majority and minority parties in both Houses, among other demands. Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi criticised the media for what he termed “inciting the people against us”. He said the country cannot operate without a strong Parliament.
