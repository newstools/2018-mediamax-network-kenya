Noven Owiti and Tom Rachuonyo @PeopleDailyKe Nominated MP Dennitah Ghati has called for inclusion of persons living with disabilities (PLWDs) in the Lake Region Economic Bloc (LREB) affairs. She said there are about 6.5 million PLWDs in the country and they must be actively incorporated in social, economic and political matters to improve their livelihoods and give them a fair playing field with their non-disabled counterparts. She urged governors, whose counties fall under the bloc, to spearhead the inclusion of PLWDs in the bloc activities. “We urge LREB governors  to come up with a framework to include persons living with disabilities in their agenda. This will go a long way in improving our welfare,” she said in a letter addressed to the bloc chairman Wycliffe Oparanya. Ghati, who represents PLWDs in Parliament, also urged counties to legislate a Disability Act to address their plight, including representation in the work force. At the same time, Migori nominated MCAs, have condemned exploitation of PLWDs by foreigners. Addressing the press at Kehancha town after the marking the United Nations Day of Persons Living with Disability, Benard Ochuodho and Esther Onana, representing PLWDs, said foreigners were taking PLWDs, including minors, to town centres to beg on their behalf and urged the government to curtail the trend that is rampant in the border towns.
