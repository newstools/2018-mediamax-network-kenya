January 19, 2019 is the day Mombasa will play host to the creme de la creme of Kenyan sports at the Safaricom Sports Personality of the Year Awards (SOYA). SOYA awards have traditionally been held in Nairobi and the organisers deemed it fit to broaden the scope by taking it to the coastal town as it celebrates 15 years of paying recognition to the country’s great sportsmen and women. Kenyans will be waiting with bated breath to see which sportsmen and women shall be honoured for their exploits in various disciplines in 2018. A recognised international sports icon is expected to headline the event as the celebrity guest, an initiative aimed at inspiring the sports personalities through a word of encouragement and promoting sports tourism beyond Kenyan borders. It will be interesting to see the mix of glamour and culture especially from the 700 guests expected to attend what has traditionally been a black tie event. SOYA Founder Paul Tergat lauded the top performers in sports for increasingly making Kenya an ideal tourist destination, saying: “As the organisers, we are glad to have partnered with Mombasa County, the host of this colourful event that brings together people of different walks of life and sporting disciplines.” He added: “We are looking forward to celebrate them for the great effort put into marketing Kenya as a choice destination for sports tourism and other investment opportunities.” Safaricom PLC, Multichoice, through GOtv, Communications Authority, National Social Security Fund, LapFund, Kenya Power, Sports Station, Protel Studios and Mombasa County are some of the institutions and corporate organisations that have come on board to make the awards a success.
