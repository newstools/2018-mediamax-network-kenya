Black Mamba are still fourth on the Kenya Handball Federation (KHF) men’s league standings after winning their match against Rangers by two goals last weekend to keep their hopes of clinching the league title alive. The scintillating encounter ended 31-29 in favour of Kaloleni’s Mamba as coach Martin Abunde once again won against his sibling Gerald Juma’s side for two points to take his team’s tally to 27 points from 15 matches after 13 wins and a draw. Rangers’ loss was their second in 16 matches and they also have 27 points from 13 wins and one draw. The Bungoma-based side are fifth on the log, four points ahead of sixth-placed Tigers. Prior to the Mamba loss, Rangers had beaten Mt Kenya University (MKU) Thika 25-18. Meanwhile, Strathmore won their 17th match of the season against Generation whom they beat 39-20 to extend their lead at the top of the standings to 34 points from 18 matches. Peter Mwathi’s side are chasing an unbeaten run in the remaining three matches and hoping against hope that National Cereals and Produce Board (NCPB) suffer a loss or two in their remaining five matches as that would hand them the elusive league title. However, NCPB are not letting up. They raced to a 54-20 win against University of Nairobi (UoN) for a 15th victory out of 16 matches and now have 31 points, having drawn one match. The battle for the title continued to hot up over the weekend as third-placed Ulinzi equally won their fixture against Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology (JKUAT) in a 43-25 outcome for their 15th win in 16 matches. The soldiers have 30 points, three ahead of holders Mamba who have a match in hand. Meanwhile, the battle for sixth place is also hotting up. Tigers hold the spot with 23 points from 10 wins and three draws after16 matches but they are under threat from Kenyatta University, JKUAT, Technical University of Kenya and Kakamega Flickers, who all have 20 points from 10 wins.
