St. Mary’s Hospital Nairobi that was early this year embroiled in a controversial management tussle, is back in the news again, this time for allegedly detaining a young mother for 20 days over a bill of sh. 17,000. The patient, Maryanne Lenantare, was released on Saturday, after Nairobi Woman Representative,  Esther Passaris intervened, but not without loads of drama.
