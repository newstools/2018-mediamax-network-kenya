Matatu operators in Nairobi have  began  regulating  the number of vehicles accessing the Central Business District CBD a day after agreeing to put in place self regulation measures to ease congestion in the city centre. The system that will see only a limited number of vehicles per sacco allowed into the CBD at any one given time was put in place even as president Uhuru Kenyatta revealed having ordered Nairobi governor Mike Sonko to lift  Monday’s ban on matatus from accessing the city centre.
