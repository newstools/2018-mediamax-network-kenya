The National Executive Committee of the Orange Democratic Movement – ODM  has resolved to expel Malindi MP Aisha Jumwa and her Msambweni counterpart Suleiman Dori for gross misconduct. The move comes in the wake of the party’s  disciplinary committee report  which recommended the expulsion of the rebel MPs who have been vocal in expressing support for Deputy President William Ruto’s 2022 presidential bid. A meeting attended by party leader Raila Odinga resolved to summon the two MPs early next year to defend their dismissal alongside six members of the county assembly.
