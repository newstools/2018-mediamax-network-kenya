Emmanuel Masinde @PeopleSports Agnes Tirop has turned her focus to retaining her world cross-country championships title in Denmark next year. Title defence Fresh from winning Wareng Tuskys cross-country, Tirop asserted her authority once more by winning the fourth edition of Emoo FM Ziwa Farmers 10km run in Ziwa, Uasin Gishu County at the weekend and still wants more. “My focus now is to get a slot in Team Kenya to the world cross-country championships and I am going to train well so that I retain my title and also better my performance,” said the 23-year-old. The race, which brought together upcoming and elite athletes, started at Kabenes in the outskirts of Eldoret town with the men’s and women’s 10km event being run along the Eldoret-Ziwa road. Tirop had to battle it out with little-known Dorcas Jepchirchir, Prague marathon champion Valerie Aiyabei and former youth commonwealth games champion Stacy Ndiwa. Other winners Jepchirchir finished second after clocking 31.30.55 to beat 2016 Valencia marathon champion Aiyabei to third in 31:42.08 as Ndiwa settled fourth in 31:43.34. In the senior men’s 10km category, former Africa junior champion Nicholas Kipkorir ruled the roost as he clocked 28:20.4 to claim victory. Kipkorir, who hails from Nandi County but trains at Global Communication in Kaptagat, beat 1,500m bronze medallist Titus Kipruto to second in 28:23.4 as Albert Kangongo sealed the podium in 27:48.0.
