Manuel Ntoyai @Manuel_Ntoyai With elections done and dusted, members of the Music Copyright Society of Kenya (MCSK) are optimistic that the new board will return the body to its former glory. The collective management organisation conducted elections in its eight regions across the country on Thursday. In Nairobi, veteran gospel singer Japheth Kassanga floored his opponents with the runners-up, John Mwangi, automatically clinching the director’s seat. In Rift Valley, Mwangi Paul took the seat, while Jim Likembe won in Nyanza. John Katana retained his seat in Coast while singer Shisia Joseph (popular for his song Omundu Mulosi) was elected in Western, with Lazarus Muli retaining his Eastern seat. “I want to thank God and the members for giving me this opportunity to serve fellow musicians. I know the task ahead is hard, given the fact that Mcsk’s licence wasn’t renewed by the Kenya Copyright Board. I know with my experience, I will help put the right structure into place,” Kassanga told Spice after his win.
