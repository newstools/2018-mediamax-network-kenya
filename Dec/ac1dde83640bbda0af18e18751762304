This year’s KCPE candidates began receiving their  form one admission letters to join national, extra-county and county schools in january 2019, this after the ministry of education completed the placement in one phase following the digitization of the process. Unlike previous years, the new admission rules require students to submit their admission letters online to ensure transparency and curb fraud in the admission process.
