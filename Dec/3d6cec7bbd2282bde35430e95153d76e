Opposition leader Raila Odinga has accused Members of Parliament of insensitivity to the plight of Kenyans struggling under difficult economic times. In a statement signed by his spokesman Dennis Onyango yesterday, Raila Odinga said he was deeply disturbed by MPs’ attempts to raise their pay and related perks at a time the country is facing economic difficulties. “Raila is concerned that the pay hike conspiracy by MPs is coming at a time other public sector employees such as teachers, nurses and civil servants are going through pay restraint and are generally accepting less pay for much work,” said the statement. The Opposition leader termed the Parliamentary Service Commission Bill currently before the National Assembly, a case of “grand larceny and an anti-people and insensitive demand that should be disowned and rejected as inappropriate and unacceptable to a majority of Kenyans”. He appealed to the MPs to appreciate that the country is struggling with huge debts that cut through the broad spectrum of the economy and deficits strangling critical sectors. Raila further appealed to the lawmakers to avoid returning the country to the pre-2010 Constitution days. The Constitution gives the Salaries and Remuneration Commission the mandate do determine salaries and perks of all public officials.
