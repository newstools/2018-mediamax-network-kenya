Milan, Monday @PeopleSport11 Roma battled back for a 2-2 draw which denied Inter Milan second place in Serie A on Sunday in a Stadio Olimpico thriller between two sides looking to impress after losing in Europe during the week. Keita Balde Diao gave Inter the half-time lead amid Roma fury at having a penalty appeal denied, but the side from the capital powered back with a Cendiz Under scorcher after the break. Aleksandar Kolarov slotted in a penalty to seal a point for the Romans to cancel out Inter captain Mauro Icardi’s header. Inter who lost to Tottenham Hotspur in the Champions League midweek remain third, level on 29 points with second-placed Napoli who travel to Atalanta on Monday. Champions Juventus opened up an 11-point lead on Napoli with a 3-0 win at Fiorentina Saturday with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring from the spot to bag his 10th goal in 14 games. “It was a very entertaining match for all watching and I think a valuable point for both teams,” said Inter coach Luciano Spalletti. “It shows we are on the right track.” Roma who advanced to the Champions League knockout rounds despite losing to Real Madrid have only won one of their last six league matches and are down in seventh place. Eusebio Di Francesco’s side were furious they were denied a penalty call after Danilo D’Ambrosio tripped Nicolò Zaniolo before Keita broke through after 37 minutes. D’Ambrosio then set up Senegalese winger Keita to blast in a volley from close range. “It’s shameful,” said AS Roma legend Francesco Totti. “I want to know, and we all do, how those in the VAR booth didn’t see that foul. We all saw it on a far smaller screen. –AFP
